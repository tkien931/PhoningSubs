1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
I'm going to show you my room.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
The room is a little hot.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
I'm going to show you my room.

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
The room is a little hot.

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
The room is a little hot.

6
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
I opened the window.

7
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
But...

8
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
It's not cool.

9
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
It's not cool.

10
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
How far do I have to open it?

11
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Oh, the sunlight.

12
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Oh, the sunlight.

13
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Oh, the sunlight.

14
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Oh, the sunlight.

15
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Oh, the sunlight.

16
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Oh, the sunlight.

17
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Oh, the sunlight.

18
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
I organized everything in my room I needed to.

19
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I think majority.

20
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
But I need...

21
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Wait, give me a second.

22
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Minji,

23
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Do you want to color it later?

24
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Do you want to color it later?

25
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Okay.

26
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Okay.

27
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Guys.

28
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I need a...

29
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Recently...

30
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Recently...

31
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
During this promotion...

32
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
During this promotion...

33
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
During this promotion...

34
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I received fan letters at once.

35
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I received fan letters at once.

36
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
So...

37
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
There are so many letters.

38
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
There are so many letters.

39
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
All of them...

40
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I want to read them one by one.

41
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
All of them...

42
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
But...

43
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
There are so many.

44
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
So I'll read them little by little.

45
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
So I'll read them little by little.

46
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
And separately...

47
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
I have another little box that I put it...

48
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
I'm putting them in.

49
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
I have another little box that I put it...

50
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
I'm putting them in.

51
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
But the thing is...

52
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
The letters that we got during...

53
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
The letters that we got during...

54
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
There midnight break.

55
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
And...

56
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
What is it?

57
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
The...

58
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
In the room...

59
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
The stuff...

60
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
The stuff...

61
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
The stuff...

62
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
The stuff...

63
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
I don't know what I read...

64
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
I don't know what I read...

65
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
And what I didn't read...

66
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Because I did organize...

67
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Which letters I had read and had to leave...

68
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Because I did organize...

69
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:33,000
I'm going to read them all over again just to make sure that I read every letter that

70
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:41,000
I have but guys I'm a bit of a slow reader so I don't know if I'm going to be able to

71
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,000
read it all.

72
00:02:44,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Yeah. Oh my god. Is this how I open the letter? I see. I don't have a letter open

73
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
cut up either.

74
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Oh my god. What is this sticker?

75
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Did they make it themselves?

76
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Put it down a little deeper.

77
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
There it is.

78
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Oh my god.

79
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
I'm going to read this one.

80
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Oh my god.

81
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Oh my god.

82
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Oh my god.

83
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Oh my god.

84
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Oh my god.

85
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Oh my god.

86
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Oh my god. The cutest thing ever.

87
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Hi.

88
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Hi.

89
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Hi.

90
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Well, he's steady at my door like that.

91
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Nevermind. I'm going to eat my late lunch.

92
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
I ate the last few bites too.

93
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
How long have we been eating?

94
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Huh? I don't know.

95
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:33,000
See you in 10 minutes.

96
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
It's been Minji.

97
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,420
This is a beach break.

98
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:22,440
It's

99
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:30,380
God, it's hot in here tv is melted

100
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
It's kinda hot in here.

101
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Give me a second guys.

102
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
I'm reading a letter.

103
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
It's not a letter.

104
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
It's a letter.

105
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
You're so nice.

106
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
You're so nice.

107
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
I'll read all of these letters.

108
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
There's a lot.

109
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
There's a lot of letters.

110
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
I can't show you now.

111
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
I can't show you now.

112
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Please understand if it takes a while.

113
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
It won't close.

114
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
I can't read all of them.

115
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
I can't read all of them.

116
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Woori!

117
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
I don't think this is right.

118
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
I should read all of them.

119
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Thank you.

120
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Be careful.

121
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
And...

122
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
They've given me a good place.

123
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Bye, thank you.

124
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
I'm going to go to the gym.

125
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Did you enjoy my vlog?

126
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Australia vlog.

127
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
There were so many things.

128
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
I'm going to go to the gym.

129
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
What is this?

130
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Cute.

131
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
The pants are so pretty.

132
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
I'm going to eat.

133
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
I'm going to go to the gym.

134
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
I thought about it while watching the vlog.

135
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Mia.

136
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Mia didn't come out as I thought.

137
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
People are so angry.

138
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
I think people are showing their love.

139
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
I think so.

140
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
I think people are showing their love.

141
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
I want to tell you something.

142
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Mia.

143
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Really.

144
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Unlike Millie.

145
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
I don't like attention.

146
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Sorry.

147
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
I don't like Mia.

148
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
I don't like her that much.

149
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
I have to touch her and hug her moderately.

150
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
I have to touch her and hug her moderately.

151
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Or.

152
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
I don't like her.

153
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
I really don't like her.

154
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Mia is a cat.

155
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
It's a bit of a cat personality.

156
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Mia is a completely puppy.

157
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
What is the name of the book I read in HANI for fun?

158
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
What is the name of the book I read in HANI for fun?

159
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
The book I bought?

160
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
I don't know what book it is.

161
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
I don't know.

162
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
But.

163
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
In school.

164
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
There was this like.

165
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
This little reading test thing you can do.

166
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
This little reading test thing you can do.

167
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
What should I say?

168
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Before reading a book.

169
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Before reading a book.

170
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
I learned how to check if it's right with me.

171
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
I learned how to check if it's right with me.

172
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
I learned how to check if it's right with me.

173
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
When I was in school.

174
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
It's like the five finger rule.

175
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
And um.

176
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
You just flip it to a random page.

177
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
And you read.

178
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
And if there's like words you can't.

179
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Like um.

180
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
I don't know if I remember it.

181
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
But if there's.

182
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Words that you don't know.

183
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
You pull up a finger.

184
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
And if you reach five fingers.

185
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
You either read it or you don't read it.

186
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
It was one of those two.

187
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Anyways I don't know why I told you guys that.

188
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
I didn't do that.

189
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
I didn't do that.

190
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
I opened up a page.

191
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
And I thought it was just really interesting.

192
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
I remember it being like.

193
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Like a collection of articles from.

194
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Like a collection of articles from.

195
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Back then.

196
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Do you want? Let's have a read.

197
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
I have a little.

198
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
I have a little.

199
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
I'll show you guys my room.

200
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Maybe today.

201
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
I need to think about it.

202
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Because.

203
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Yeah.

204
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
I don't know.

205
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
It just seems really interesting this book.

206
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
I like how it looks as well.

207
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
Alright.

208
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Someone.

209
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
Give me your number.

210
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
First number.

211
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
First person to give me a number.

212
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
Five.

213
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
Alright.

214
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Five.

215
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
There's no fifth.

216
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
The fifth page is index pages.

217
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
We need.

218
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
106.

219
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Thank you.

220
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Feels like in class.

221
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
I'm in class right now.

222
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
I'm going to read.

223
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Okay.

224
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
I'll do the page before.

225
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
I'll read.

226
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
Oh someone.

227
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Just read.

228
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
I'm not sure.

229
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
We like the image.

230
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:43,000
I see.

231
00:12:54,420 --> 00:12:57,420
No.

232
00:12:57,420 --> 00:12:58,420
ays.

233
00:12:58,420 --> 00:12:59,420
No, my bad.

234
00:12:59,420 --> 00:13:00,620
Okay.

235
00:13:00,620 --> 00:13:00,920
I'm sorry.

236
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:04,420
I haven't read this book yet.

237
00:13:04,420 --> 00:13:07,420
But I think it's...

238
00:13:07,420 --> 00:13:12,920
It's like a collection of history in newspapers and letters.

239
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:15,420
I think? I'm not too sure.

240
00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:19,420
But I can't wait to read it because it looks interesting.

241
00:13:23,420 --> 00:13:25,820
Yeah.

242
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:34,920
I'm reading a book called The First Edition.

243
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:37,920
Oh, First Edition.

244
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:49,920
What would you call this type of book though? I'm not too sure.

245
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:56,620
This book was printed in Great Britain.

246
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:01,920
I don't know.

247
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:08,920
What is it?

248
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:19,920
I don't know why it's off.

249
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:33,920
I wanted to try it.

250
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:34,920
I did it.

251
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:36,920
It was really fun.

252
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:38,920
But now...

253
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:42,920
Oh my god.

254
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:44,920
Alright, we gotta super glue that.

255
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:45,920
Just try it now.

256
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:48,920
Alright, I made really cute something.

257
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:53,920
I got super glue over here.

258
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:55,920
I made...

259
00:14:55,920 --> 00:15:01,920
I made really cute somethings.

260
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:02,920
Me...

261
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:09,920
I was doing it and then Minji came into my room and she saw me and I asked her if she wanted to join so she joined me.

262
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:12,920
And then Hyein also joined.

263
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:13,920
And that's how...

264
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:15,920
We got started.

265
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:17,920
I don't know if that's gonna stick well.

266
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:22,920
I hope it does.

267
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:23,920
I need a fix.

268
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:24,920
Hyein is a bug.

269
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:27,920
I don't know how to fix it.

270
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:28,920
This is a magnet.

271
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:29,920
Ah!

272
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:32,920
Okay.

273
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:34,920
Let's figure out how it goes in first.

274
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:36,920
Oh my god.

275
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:40,920
Okay.

276
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:41,920
And then we're gonna stick it on.

277
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:44,920
Super glue is the best guys.

278
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:46,920
But don't...

279
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:49,920
glue your fingers together.

280
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:53,920
Oh my god.

281
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:54,920
It's so cute.

282
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:57,920
Watch!

283
00:15:58,920 --> 00:15:59,920
Wait.

284
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:00,920
I'm gonna die.

285
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:01,920
It's gonna die because of you guys.

286
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:03,920
Minji, you're the real man CEOs.

287
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:05,920
happening.

288
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:06,920
Yeah.

289
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:09,920
I wore my You're my self

290
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:21,920
Did my kur-

291
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:23,920
It's very crispy in here.

292
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:25,920
I think that's right.

293
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:28,920
So we're just checking them.

294
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:34,920
Just checking them.

295
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:40,920
We have a guest coming over a little bit as well.

296
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:44,920
So we need to clean our dorm.

297
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:56,920
Alright, let's check them. Where's Minji?

298
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:00,920
But it's a bit...

299
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:02,920
Ah, is it this one?

300
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:07,920
No wonder. There was like extra two.

301
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:12,920
I was like, no, I remember using up all the magnets.

302
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:15,920
But they fell out.

303
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:19,920
I guess they didn't stick too well in there, did they?

304
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:27,920
The person with the long blonde hair in the vlog is my sister.

305
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:31,920
She was...

306
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:33,920
Yeah, she's very...

307
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:37,920
up to date with everything.

308
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:43,920
I was really surprised.

309
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:45,920
The long blonde hair...

310
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:47,920
Oh my gosh!

311
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:51,920
Oh guys, I thought I superglued my finger to the thing.

312
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:52,920
But I didn't. It's alright.

313
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:55,920
And I made it really cute.

314
00:17:56,920 --> 00:17:58,920
Oh, maybe we should paint it now.

315
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:01,920
I don't think we have time right now.

316
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:02,920
Can we do this for an hour?

317
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:03,920
I think we can do this for an hour.

318
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:05,920
But what if it gets too dirty?

319
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:07,920
Let's go find Minji.

320
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:10,920
Minji!

321
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:13,920
Minji!

322
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:24,920
Minji!

323
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:25,920
Minji!

324
00:18:26,420 --> 00:18:26,920
Can I come?

325
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:27,920
No, you can't.

326
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:28,920
Well, no.

327
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:29,920
Oh my gosh.

328
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:30,920
Minji!

329
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:31,920
Well, actually...

330
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:32,920
Hi, Minji.

331
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:33,920
I bought this janitor hat.

332
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:34,920
Peepi.

333
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:35,920
Peepi?

334
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:37,920
Short hair.

335
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:38,920
Peepi.

336
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:42,920
Let's go into it.

337
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:43,920
Peepi, hey there.

338
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:44,920
What?

339
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:45,920
Congratulations.

340
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:46,920
Enjoy what you're going to do.

341
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:48,920
Yourition's short,оп sino pepero o po dutano ho 쵹

342
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:49,920

Qua dea?

344
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:54,660
I don't know. I feel like...

345
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:56,420
Sorry, I just put my lip balm on.

346
00:18:56,420 --> 00:18:57,920
I feel like if I move around...

347
00:18:58,680 --> 00:19:00,420
I dropped the lip balm on you guys.

348
00:19:01,620 --> 00:19:04,420
I feel like if I move around, it just happens to...

349
00:19:05,420 --> 00:19:08,120
Guys, I also prepared a lot of presents.

350
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:10,920
I'm so proud. I think I bought a good one.

351
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:14,420
I have to pack it.

352
00:19:17,020 --> 00:19:20,420
Alright, let's get this arts and crafts box.

353
00:19:20,620 --> 00:19:22,420
Guys, I'm...

354
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:25,120
I'm gonna go. I'm going.

355
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:27,920
Because I have to color this.

356
00:19:28,620 --> 00:19:29,620
So...

357
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:31,520
I'm going.

358
00:19:32,420 --> 00:19:33,520
Don't worry.

359
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:35,520
I'll show you something else.

360
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:36,520
Okay?

361
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:40,120
Okay?

362
00:19:41,420 --> 00:19:43,920
Color? Right, I have to color something.

363
00:19:44,420 --> 00:19:45,420
Alright.

364
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:49,520
Hello, everyone.

365
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:54,420
I'm going to go now.

366
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:57,420
Bye.

367
00:19:58,420 --> 00:19:59,920
I'll keep you updated.

00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:01,420
Bye.
