1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Where's your head?

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
She's a headless friend!

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
No, I'm not headless! I have a head!

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Look at here.

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Aww, pink!

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Pink head!

7
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Really cute!

8
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Stop it!

9
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Stop it!

10
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Hi!

11
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Hi!

12
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Why did you come to Bonnie's?

13
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
I just read the comments.

14
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
I think your face is too moist.

15
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
It's okay.

16
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I was lost today.

17
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
We did it ourselves.

18
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Do you guys want to see comments?

19
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Stay in the middle.

20
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Middle!

21
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
I'm really...

22
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I'm sorry. I'm so awkward.

23
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
I'm going through awkward situations.

24
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Everyone, stand here one line.

25
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
One line?

26
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Let's show our costumes.

27
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Can we each choose?

28
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
This can be the Christmas card.

29
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Okay.

30
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Okay, then, wait a minute.

31
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Let's all focus on the characters.

32
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Three!

33
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I got an item.

34
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
One!

35
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Pose like this.

36
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Like this.

37
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Okay.

38
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Yes!

39
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Yay!

40
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Merry Christmas!

41
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I want to turn on the music.

42
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Wait, wait.

43
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Wait a minute.

44
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
We can turn on the music and replace it with a ballad.

45
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
We can turn on the music and replace it with a ballad.

46
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Can we sing our song?

47
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Shall we sing our song?

48
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Shall we sing our song?

49
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Shall we sing our song?

50
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
How are you guys?

51
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
It's Christmas Eve today.

52
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
How are you spending your day?

53
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
I did this for the fire today.

54
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
It looks cold.

55
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
I did the same.

56
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
camaraderie

57
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Oh, but I can't see it.

58
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
I want to get a gift quickly.

59
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Oh, yes!

60
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Oh, yes!

61
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
You have to explain.

62
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Oh, my God.

63
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
We decorated the tree like this.

64
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Oh, my God.

65
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
We decorated the tree like this.

66
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
But I think we need some explanation.

67
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
But I think we need some explanation.

68
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
We do this every year.

69
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
We do this every year.

70
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:30,000
We've been doing this for a few years since we were trainees.

71
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
That's right. But today, with the BUNNYs,

72
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:37,000
I really wanted to do it with you guys.

73
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:41,000
I thought we should do it live.

74
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:48,000
I'm waiting for our Manito gifts in the tree.

75
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Can you see it?

76
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Can you get a little closer?

77
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
I'm looking forward to it.

78
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Anyway, everyone...

79
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,000
We can't STACK BEFORE 찰칵 we sing .

80
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Our words might change.

81
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:44,000
I've never tried advised be, but...

82
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:48,000
my mom has tried it,

83
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,000
and it is sweet, and not too sweet.

84
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
It's amazing.

85
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Say, Q scars.

86
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:57,880
I got a cake.

87
00:03:57,880 --> 00:03:59,120
Good job.

88
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:00,320
Yay!

89
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:01,880
I'm going to do a couple dance.

90
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:03,000
This is it.

91
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
This is it.

92
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:09,760
I'm going to do it.

93
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:12,040
What are you doing?

94
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:14,960
I'll do it.

95
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:15,840
How?

96
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:16,920
I'll do it like this.

97
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:18,480
I'll be the teacher at the prom.

98
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:19,360
Okay.

99
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:21,080
Watch everyone.

100
00:04:21,080 --> 00:04:22,640
I'm good at this with Minzy.

101
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:24,280
Ready, go.

102
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:25,400
I've never done this before.

103
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:26,400
Ready, go.

104
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:27,600
How?

105
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:29,520
I'll do it with Minzy.

106
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:32,960
I'm good at this with Hyelin.

107
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:33,560
Okay.

108
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:34,400
Wait.

109
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:36,960
Viewers.

110
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:37,840
Boom!

111
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:44,560
I didn't see that coming.

112
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:45,240
Why?

113
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:46,680
I didn't see that coming.

114
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:47,760
Sorry.

115
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:49,240
Did you see that?

116
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:52,320
Did I wear a hat?

117
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:54,600
I found the secret of Rudolph.

118
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:57,120
Rudolph was actually a human.

119
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:59,080
She was a human.

120
00:04:59,080 --> 00:04:59,640
Wait.

121
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:04,960
Anyway, we have to explain about weird money, too.

122
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:07,880
I've been doing this since I was a trainee.

123
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:13,320
We were always just having fun with each other.

124
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:17,520
I've never talked about it in front of Bunny's.

125
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:19,160
But we're the first.

126
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:19,960
Ba-bam.

127
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:20,840
For the first time.

128
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:21,680
Bunny's.

129
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:22,440
The first in 2013.

130
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:24,880
We haven't heard it live yet.

131
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:26,760
We're the first to show it.

132
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:28,320
Shall we show it here?

133
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:28,920
Of course.

134
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:29,920
I hope you like it.

135
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:30,520
Wait, wait.

136
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:32,320
I think we need to explain in English.

137
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:32,920
Okay.

138
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:33,440
Go on.

139
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:34,040
What if I know this guy?

140
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:47,560
So, we have been doing Secret Santa with each other since we were trainees for a few years now.

141
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:50,320
And we kept saying to you guys,

142
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:53,840
how we were doing Secret Santa and how everyone's...

143
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:56,440
My god, it's raining behind me.

144
00:05:56,440 --> 00:06:00,080
And so, we're going to...

145
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:02,440
What's 공개인용? English.

146
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:04,120
We're going to just show you.

147
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:08,680
We're going to reveal our Secret Santas with you guys.

148
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:13,160
So, look forward because I was such a pro in 보장.

149
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:14,760
Seriously, like A+.

150
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:16,800
A+, you know, 100 points.

151
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:18,280
I was the best.

152
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:19,200
We...

153
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:20,160
We... I...

154
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:24,800
I feel like we're the ones that go full out with the decorations and the 보장.

155
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:26,960
But today, I...

156
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:27,560
No, okay.

157
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:29,520
I was like...

158
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:31,040
Because I really...

159
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:33,120
Like, the wrapping paper is key for me.

160
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:36,200
Like, it has to be pretty and it has to be perfect.

161
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:39,440
But I couldn't find the wrapping paper I wanted.

162
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:43,800
So, I was wandering around like this.

163
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:49,040
I couldn't be satisfied with the wrapping paper.

164
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:49,600
Anyways.

165
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:51,600
Should we show a little more?

166
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:52,160
Okay.

167
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:54,080
Or should we just guess who it is?

168
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:55,400
Okay.

169
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:57,600
Everyone, come into one frame again.

170
00:06:57,600 --> 00:07:00,360
I have an idea. Can I give it to you?

171
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:06,600
We do rock, paper, scissors and the winner brings one of these.

172
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:10,160
So, we bring it and the winner takes it.

173
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:11,160
So...

174
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:12,480
No, no.

175
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:13,680
I can't answer.

176
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:15,200
Because the gift is too...

177
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:16,600
It's revealed.

178
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:18,600
We can guess the gift.

179
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:19,440
Okay.

180
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:20,340
Oh..

181
00:07:20,540 --> 00:07:21,800
Jooheon?

182
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:24,160
How would you play rock, paper, scissors?

183
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:27,600
Panneur Miaen.

184
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:28,040
Go back to Panneur Miaen.

185
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:48,640
handmade

186
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:51,740
Sorry. Sorry, guys.

187
00:07:51,740 --> 00:07:54,940
I'll take care of it.

188
00:07:54,940 --> 00:07:56,940
I'm a bit...

189
00:07:56,940 --> 00:07:58,940
She looks like a kangaroo.

190
00:07:58,940 --> 00:08:00,940
Wow, she does.

191
00:08:00,940 --> 00:08:02,940
Rudolph.

192
00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:04,940
Rudolph.

193
00:08:04,940 --> 00:08:06,940
Rudolph.

194
00:08:06,940 --> 00:08:08,940
Rudolph.

195
00:08:08,940 --> 00:08:10,940
Rudolph.

196
00:08:10,940 --> 00:08:12,940
Anyway.

197
00:08:12,940 --> 00:08:14,940
Okay.

198
00:08:14,940 --> 00:08:16,940
Mic.

199
00:08:16,940 --> 00:08:18,940
I have something to say.

200
00:08:18,940 --> 00:08:20,940
Like this?

201
00:08:20,940 --> 00:08:22,940
Turn it over.

202
00:08:22,940 --> 00:08:24,940
Like this.

203
00:08:24,940 --> 00:08:26,940
Guys.

204
00:08:26,940 --> 00:08:28,940
Ah!

205
00:08:28,940 --> 00:08:30,940
Mic, mic.

206
00:08:30,940 --> 00:08:32,940
From the top.

207
00:08:32,940 --> 00:08:34,940
Like this.

208
00:08:34,940 --> 00:08:36,940
I can't see.

209
00:08:36,940 --> 00:08:38,940
I can see.

210
00:08:38,940 --> 00:08:40,940
It's ambiguous.

211
00:08:42,940 --> 00:08:44,940
We have a memory like this.

212
00:08:44,940 --> 00:08:46,940
In 2023,

213
00:08:46,940 --> 00:08:48,940
I'll say it as Santa.

214
00:08:48,940 --> 00:08:50,940
I'll say it as Santa.

215
00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:51,940
What?

216
00:08:51,940 --> 00:08:52,940
What do you mean by that?

217
00:08:52,940 --> 00:08:53,940
No.

218
00:08:53,940 --> 00:08:55,940
There's no Santa.

219
00:08:55,940 --> 00:08:56,940
So,

220
00:08:56,940 --> 00:08:58,940
From now on,

221
00:08:58,940 --> 00:09:00,940
Let's reveal each other's secret Santa.

222
00:09:00,940 --> 00:09:02,940
Let's reveal each other's secret Santa.

223
00:09:02,940 --> 00:09:04,940
Let's reveal each other's secret Santa.

224
00:09:06,940 --> 00:09:07,940
Okay.

225
00:09:07,940 --> 00:09:09,940
Then, the members.

226
00:09:09,940 --> 00:09:10,940
Who is it?

227
00:09:10,940 --> 00:09:11,940
I...

228
00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:12,940
I have an idea.

229
00:09:12,940 --> 00:09:13,940
I have an idea.

230
00:09:13,940 --> 00:09:14,440
What is it?

231
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:14,940
Here.

232
00:09:14,940 --> 00:09:15,940
Here.

233
00:09:15,940 --> 00:09:16,940
Tingle.

234
00:09:16,940 --> 00:09:17,940
One person sits here.

235
00:09:17,940 --> 00:09:18,940
One person sits here.

236
00:09:18,940 --> 00:09:19,940
One person sits here.

237
00:09:19,940 --> 00:09:20,940
One person sits here,

238
00:09:20,940 --> 00:09:21,940
One person sits here,

239
00:09:21,940 --> 00:09:22,940
One person sits here.

240
00:09:22,940 --> 00:09:23,940
and

241
00:09:23,940 --> 00:09:24,940
members,

242
00:09:24,940 --> 00:09:25,940
come and

243
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:26,940
give presents.

244
00:09:26,940 --> 00:09:27,940
Hold the present with their eyes.

245
00:09:27,940 --> 00:09:28,940
They're going to do this.

246
00:09:28,940 --> 00:09:29,940
Who is it?

247
00:09:29,940 --> 00:09:31,940
Tell me first.

248
00:09:31,940 --> 00:09:32,940
Then,

249
00:09:32,940 --> 00:09:33,940
You can make an announcement first.

250
00:09:33,940 --> 00:09:34,940
The last person will be the winner.

251
00:09:34,940 --> 00:09:35,940
Rock, paper, scissors.

252
00:09:35,940 --> 00:09:36,940
Whoever loses first.

253
00:09:36,940 --> 00:09:37,940
OK.

254
00:09:37,940 --> 00:09:38,940
Who is it?

255
00:09:38,940 --> 00:09:40,940
Rock, paper, scissors.

256
00:09:40,940 --> 00:09:41,940
Rock, paper, scissors.

257
00:09:41,940 --> 00:09:42,940
What is it?

258
00:09:42,940 --> 00:09:43,940
What is it?

259
00:09:43,940 --> 00:09:44,940
You shouldn't do this.

260
00:09:44,940 --> 00:09:45,940
You shouldn't do this.

261
00:09:45,940 --> 00:09:46,940
You shouldn't do this.

262
00:09:46,940 --> 00:09:47,940
You're this bad.

263
00:09:47,940 --> 00:09:49,940
Rock, paper, scissors!

264
00:09:49,940 --> 00:09:51,940
No, no, no, it's a ball.

265
00:09:51,940 --> 00:09:53,940
Then what's a fist?

266
00:09:53,940 --> 00:09:55,940
A ball.

267
00:09:55,940 --> 00:09:57,940
I have to do it too.

268
00:09:57,940 --> 00:09:59,940
Rock, paper, scissors!

269
00:10:01,940 --> 00:10:03,940
What is this?

270
00:10:03,940 --> 00:10:05,940
Is it a real person?

271
00:10:05,940 --> 00:10:07,940
When did you express this?

272
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:09,940
It's a thumbs up.

273
00:10:09,940 --> 00:10:11,940
Please do it with me, Luffy.

274
00:10:13,940 --> 00:10:15,940
Rock, paper, scissors!

275
00:10:15,940 --> 00:10:17,940
You and I.

276
00:10:17,940 --> 00:10:19,940
Rock, paper, scissors!

277
00:10:25,940 --> 00:10:27,940
Rock, paper, scissors!

278
00:10:29,940 --> 00:10:31,940
Please sit down.

279
00:10:31,940 --> 00:10:33,940
Which Randy are you?

280
00:10:33,940 --> 00:10:35,940
Are you Spencer?

281
00:10:39,940 --> 00:10:41,940
It must hurt so much!

282
00:10:45,940 --> 00:10:47,940
I'll take a short break.

283
00:10:47,940 --> 00:10:49,940
Okay.

284
00:10:49,940 --> 00:10:51,940
I have to wash my face.

285
00:10:51,940 --> 00:10:53,940
You have to close your eyes.

286
00:10:53,940 --> 00:10:55,940
Okay?

287
00:10:55,940 --> 00:10:57,940
Then...

288
00:10:57,940 --> 00:10:59,940
Behind you.

289
00:10:59,940 --> 00:11:01,940
I have one more.

290
00:11:01,940 --> 00:11:03,940
I have one more.

291
00:11:03,940 --> 00:11:05,940
No, no.

292
00:11:05,940 --> 00:11:07,940
Behind you.

293
00:11:07,940 --> 00:11:09,940
I can see the stars.

294
00:11:09,940 --> 00:11:11,940
I'm the first.

295
00:11:11,940 --> 00:11:13,940
Just do it.

296
00:11:13,940 --> 00:11:15,940
I have to look at the stars.

297
00:11:15,940 --> 00:11:17,940
This one is just holding a stone.

298
00:11:17,940 --> 00:11:19,940
No, no.

299
00:11:19,940 --> 00:11:21,940
Why are you doing this?

300
00:11:21,940 --> 00:11:23,940
You can't fall.

301
00:11:23,940 --> 00:11:25,940
You can't do that.

302
00:11:25,940 --> 00:11:27,940
You have to be careful.

303
00:11:27,940 --> 00:11:29,940
What's going up?

304
00:11:29,940 --> 00:11:31,940
What's going up?

305
00:11:31,940 --> 00:11:33,940
There's a chair.

306
00:11:33,940 --> 00:11:35,940
What's this?

307
00:11:35,940 --> 00:11:37,940
Wait a minute.

308
00:11:37,940 --> 00:11:39,940
Then you sit down and raise your hand up here.

309
00:11:39,940 --> 00:11:41,940
Oh, okay.

310
00:11:41,940 --> 00:11:43,940
You raise your hand first. Then you do this.

311
00:11:43,940 --> 00:11:45,940
This is too dangerous.

312
00:11:45,940 --> 00:11:47,940
Okay, okay.

313
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:49,940
Here we go, everyone.

314
00:11:49,940 --> 00:11:51,940
Wait a minute. I'll read the comments.

315
00:11:51,940 --> 00:11:53,940
Do what you want to do now.

316
00:11:53,940 --> 00:11:55,940
I can do it, too.

317
00:11:55,940 --> 00:11:57,940
I can do it, too.

318
00:11:57,940 --> 00:11:59,940
You're a real mess.

319
00:11:59,940 --> 00:12:01,940
You're pretty.

320
00:12:01,940 --> 00:12:03,940
Thank you.

321
00:12:03,940 --> 00:12:05,940
Hey, don't mess with the dude.

322
00:12:07,940 --> 00:12:09,940
Minzy, let's get married.

323
00:12:09,940 --> 00:12:11,940
I can't.

324
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:13,940
I'm sorry, but don't read the questions.

325
00:12:13,940 --> 00:12:15,940
Why are you reading the questions?

326
00:12:15,940 --> 00:12:17,940
Why are you reading the questions?

327
00:12:17,940 --> 00:12:19,940
I think you want to get married.

328
00:12:19,940 --> 00:12:21,940
Honey, I love you.

329
00:12:21,940 --> 00:12:23,940
I think I wanna marry you.

330
00:12:23,940 --> 00:12:25,940
I think I wanna marry you.

331
00:12:25,940 --> 00:12:27,940
No, everyone.

332
00:12:27,940 --> 00:12:29,940
If you don't have any questions, we'll start.

333
00:12:29,940 --> 00:12:31,940
Let's get started.

334
00:12:31,940 --> 00:12:33,940
Morani, did you close your eyes?

335
00:12:33,940 --> 00:12:35,940
Who do you think is your Manito?

336
00:12:35,940 --> 00:12:37,940
Who do you think is your Manito?

337
00:12:37,940 --> 00:12:39,940
Who do you think is your Manito?

338
00:12:39,940 --> 00:12:41,940
Please tell me.

339
00:12:41,940 --> 00:12:43,940
Me?

340
00:12:43,940 --> 00:12:45,940
Me.

341
00:12:45,940 --> 00:12:47,940
Me?

342
00:12:47,940 --> 00:12:49,940
Me.

343
00:12:49,940 --> 00:12:51,940
Um...

344
00:12:51,940 --> 00:12:53,940
Um...

345
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:55,940
I...

346
00:12:55,940 --> 00:12:57,940
First of all,

347
00:12:57,940 --> 00:12:59,940
Should I keep closing my eyes?

348
00:12:59,940 --> 00:13:01,940
I should keep closing my eyes?

349
00:13:01,940 --> 00:13:03,940
You have to tell me now.

350
00:13:03,940 --> 00:13:05,940
It's frustrating.

351
00:13:09,940 --> 00:13:11,940
I thought it was Hyerin at first.

352
00:13:11,940 --> 00:13:13,940
I thought it was Hyerin at first.

353
00:13:13,940 --> 00:13:17,240
But that was in the beginning

354
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:21,740
Because Hyerin's face was always suspicious

355
00:13:21,740 --> 00:13:23,340
Suspicious?

356
00:13:23,340 --> 00:13:29,240
But after a certain period of time

357
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:33,940
Hyerin started to ask me a lot of questions

358
00:13:33,940 --> 00:13:37,440
And I felt like she was talking about Manito

359
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:41,240
And when she was talking about Manito

360
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:45,840
She said that wasn't me

361
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:48,040
So I changed my mind

362
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:51,040
I thought it was Hyerin

363
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:53,640
Because Hyerin was suspicious, too

364
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:57,240
But it wasn't the reason

365
00:13:57,240 --> 00:13:57,940
What?

366
00:13:57,940 --> 00:13:59,940
I'd choose...

367
00:13:59,940 --> 00:14:02,740
Hyerin

368
00:14:02,740 --> 00:14:04,940
If you've been hit, you get given a weapon

369
00:14:04,940 --> 00:14:05,440
Yes

370
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:06,640
Or you get a present

371
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:08,440
If you get hit, give me a hug

372
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:10,040
But you can't receive it

373
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:11,040
If you get hit, give me a hug

374
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:11,140
Give it to me

375
00:14:11,140 --> 00:14:12,140
Then, let's move on.

376
00:14:12,140 --> 00:14:14,140
It's better to find out the Manito.

377
00:14:14,140 --> 00:14:15,140
Manito...

378
00:14:15,140 --> 00:14:16,140
It doesn't matter.

379
00:14:16,140 --> 00:14:19,140
It's better not to find out the Manito.

380
00:14:20,140 --> 00:14:22,140
The mic is there, right?

381
00:14:22,140 --> 00:14:23,140
I can't see it.

382
00:14:24,140 --> 00:14:25,140
Are you smiling?

383
00:14:25,140 --> 00:14:26,140
Close your eyes, quickly.

384
00:14:26,140 --> 00:14:27,140
Minyoung.

385
00:14:27,140 --> 00:14:28,140
Close your eyes.

386
00:14:29,140 --> 00:14:30,140
I chose the last one.

387
00:14:30,140 --> 00:14:32,140
It's Hyein.

388
00:14:33,140 --> 00:14:34,140
I think so.

389
00:14:34,140 --> 00:14:35,140
Roll up.

390
00:14:38,140 --> 00:14:39,140
It's a mistake.

391
00:14:39,140 --> 00:14:40,140
I can't see it.

392
00:14:40,140 --> 00:14:41,140
It's a mistake.

393
00:14:41,140 --> 00:14:42,140
Hyein chose...

394
00:14:42,140 --> 00:14:44,140
Dani's choice was Hyein.

395
00:14:44,140 --> 00:14:45,140
Whose was it?

396
00:14:45,140 --> 00:14:46,140
It's purple.

397
00:14:46,140 --> 00:14:47,140
It's a game.

398
00:14:48,140 --> 00:14:49,140
It's a real game.

399
00:14:49,140 --> 00:14:53,140
Hyein, if Dani's Manito is right,

400
00:14:53,140 --> 00:14:56,140
please put the present on the desk.

401
00:14:56,140 --> 00:14:57,140
Are you closing your eyes?

402
00:14:57,140 --> 00:14:58,140
Yes.

403
00:15:00,140 --> 00:15:01,140
If not,

404
00:15:02,140 --> 00:15:04,140
you can leave.

405
00:15:06,140 --> 00:15:07,140
We...

406
00:15:09,140 --> 00:15:10,140
ah!

407
00:15:10,140 --> 00:15:11,140
Ah!

408
00:15:13,140 --> 00:15:14,140
Ah!

409
00:15:19,140 --> 00:15:24,140
5, 4, 3, 2, 1.

410
00:15:26,140 --> 00:15:27,140
You got it.

411
00:15:29,140 --> 00:15:30,140
Yay!

412
00:15:32,140 --> 00:15:33,140
For no reason,

413
00:15:33,140 --> 00:15:35,140
My Manito.

414
00:15:35,140 --> 00:15:38,140
She knows it.

415
00:15:38,140 --> 00:15:39,140
Try it.

416
00:15:39,140 --> 00:15:41,140
How did I know?

417
00:15:41,140 --> 00:15:43,140
I think I have like a sixth sense.

418
00:15:43,140 --> 00:15:45,140
I was surprised.

419
00:15:45,140 --> 00:15:49,140
First of all, I'm so proud of Rudolph.

420
00:15:49,140 --> 00:15:51,140
Now, for the first time...

421
00:15:51,140 --> 00:15:53,140
There are three of us now.

422
00:15:53,140 --> 00:15:55,140
It's getting easier as we go back.

423
00:15:55,140 --> 00:15:59,140
But as a person who sat here for the first time,

424
00:15:59,140 --> 00:16:02,140
I'm so proud of myself.

425
00:16:02,140 --> 00:16:05,140
Should we do the opening now or do it alone?

426
00:16:05,140 --> 00:16:07,140
Or...

427
00:16:07,140 --> 00:16:09,140
Should we do it one last time?

428
00:16:09,140 --> 00:16:11,140
I have a gift that I didn't bring.

429
00:16:11,140 --> 00:16:12,140
Okay.

430
00:16:12,140 --> 00:16:13,140
It's important.

431
00:16:13,140 --> 00:16:15,140
How big is it?

432
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:17,140
How good is it?

433
00:16:17,140 --> 00:16:19,140
Then let's do it last.

434
00:16:19,140 --> 00:16:21,140
I'm getting up.

435
00:16:21,140 --> 00:16:23,140
Can't we just open it here?

436
00:16:23,140 --> 00:16:25,140
I can't see it well right now.

437
00:16:25,140 --> 00:16:27,140
You can take it off.

438
00:16:27,140 --> 00:16:29,140
You can take it off.

439
00:16:29,140 --> 00:16:31,140
Yes.

440
00:16:31,140 --> 00:16:33,140
I pressed it a little.

441
00:16:33,140 --> 00:16:35,140
Then what should I do with my gift?

442
00:16:35,140 --> 00:16:37,140
I'll write it on the camera.

443
00:16:37,140 --> 00:16:39,140
Let's think about it.

444
00:16:39,140 --> 00:16:40,140
No, the camera.

445
00:16:40,140 --> 00:16:42,140
I didn't bring it at all.

446
00:16:42,140 --> 00:16:44,140
It's all red.

447
00:16:44,140 --> 00:16:45,140
Then hug me.

448
00:16:45,140 --> 00:16:46,140
It's winter, so...

449
00:16:46,140 --> 00:16:48,140
Just do what's in there.

450
00:16:48,140 --> 00:16:51,140
Then we can gather later, right?

451
00:16:51,140 --> 00:16:53,140
Wait.

452
00:16:53,140 --> 00:16:55,140
Why?

453
00:16:55,140 --> 00:16:56,140
But that's...

454
00:16:56,140 --> 00:16:58,140
Let's proceed.

455
00:16:58,140 --> 00:16:59,140
Let's proceed.

456
00:16:59,140 --> 00:17:01,140
Then don't open it first.

457
00:17:01,140 --> 00:17:03,140
Okay.

458
00:17:04,140 --> 00:17:06,140
No, can't we open it?

459
00:17:06,140 --> 00:17:08,140
No, we can't.

460
00:17:08,140 --> 00:17:09,140
Or...

461
00:17:09,140 --> 00:17:11,140
Or should we open it at once?

462
00:17:11,140 --> 00:17:12,140
All of us?

463
00:17:12,140 --> 00:17:14,140
When we're alone?

464
00:17:14,140 --> 00:17:16,140
Then we just...

465
00:17:16,140 --> 00:17:17,140
I'm sorry.

466
00:17:17,140 --> 00:17:18,140
Where are you?

467
00:17:18,140 --> 00:17:19,140
Okay.

468
00:17:19,140 --> 00:17:21,140
Let's do it tomorrow, everyone.

469
00:17:22,140 --> 00:17:24,140
The gift will be released two days later.

470
00:17:24,140 --> 00:17:25,140
Okay.

471
00:17:25,140 --> 00:17:27,140
I'm so curious.

472
00:17:27,140 --> 00:17:28,140
Take it.

473
00:17:28,140 --> 00:17:31,140
Let's think about it when we're done.

474
00:17:31,140 --> 00:17:33,140
Let's think about it when we're done.

475
00:17:33,140 --> 00:17:34,140
Okay.

476
00:17:34,140 --> 00:17:35,140
It's me now.

477
00:17:35,140 --> 00:17:37,140
I'll give you the one you wrote down here.

478
00:17:37,140 --> 00:17:38,140
Okay.

479
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:39,140
It's me.

480
00:17:40,140 --> 00:17:41,140
Mic.

481
00:17:42,140 --> 00:17:43,140
Where's the mic?

482
00:17:43,140 --> 00:17:44,140
It's hard.

483
00:17:44,140 --> 00:17:45,140
The mic is always gone.

484
00:17:45,140 --> 00:17:46,140
It's too...

485
00:17:46,140 --> 00:17:47,140
Too...

486
00:17:47,140 --> 00:17:48,140
Too...

487
00:17:48,140 --> 00:17:50,140
Okay, we have to go back.

488
00:17:50,140 --> 00:17:51,140
Okay.

489
00:17:51,140 --> 00:17:54,140
Who do you think is your manito?

490
00:17:56,140 --> 00:17:57,140
Back, back.

491
00:17:57,140 --> 00:17:59,140
I...

492
00:18:02,140 --> 00:18:03,140
Ah!

493
00:18:05,140 --> 00:18:08,140
I keep hearing the sound of a tiger.

494
00:18:08,140 --> 00:18:11,140
I like the sound of a tiger.

495
00:18:11,140 --> 00:18:13,140
If it's not Hyerin...

496
00:18:14,140 --> 00:18:17,140
If it's not Hyerin, it's like Dani.

497
00:18:21,140 --> 00:18:23,140
Bunny's...

498
00:18:23,140 --> 00:18:24,140
I'll go with Dani.

499
00:18:24,140 --> 00:18:25,140
Okay.

500
00:18:26,140 --> 00:18:28,140
What about you, Mojani?

501
00:18:28,140 --> 00:18:30,140
If Minji's manito is right,

502
00:18:30,140 --> 00:18:33,140
Then can I just read the comments?

503
00:18:33,140 --> 00:18:34,140
The gift...

504
00:18:35,140 --> 00:18:37,140
Please put it down in front of you.

505
00:18:40,140 --> 00:18:41,140
Did you close your eyes?

506
00:18:41,140 --> 00:18:42,140
Yes.

507
00:18:42,140 --> 00:18:43,140
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

508
00:18:43,140 --> 00:18:45,140
You should start from the back.

509
00:18:45,140 --> 00:18:46,140
Here, here.

510
00:18:46,140 --> 00:18:47,140
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

511
00:18:48,140 --> 00:18:49,140
No.

512
00:18:49,140 --> 00:18:50,140
No, I don't think so.

513
00:18:50,140 --> 00:18:51,140
I'm pretty.

514
00:18:51,140 --> 00:18:52,140
No, I'm pretty.

515
00:18:54,140 --> 00:18:55,140
I'm crying.

516
00:18:55,140 --> 00:18:56,140
I'm crying.

517
00:18:56,140 --> 00:18:57,140
I caught a cold.

518
00:18:57,140 --> 00:19:00,140
Just like the ones I used to know.

519
00:19:00,140 --> 00:19:02,140
Just like the ones I used to know.

520
00:19:02,140 --> 00:19:03,140
I'm sorry.

521
00:19:03,140 --> 00:19:04,140
I'm sorry.

522
00:19:04,140 --> 00:19:05,140
But what about you?

523
00:19:05,140 --> 00:19:06,140
You're not trying to see what your name is.

524
00:19:06,140 --> 00:19:07,140
I don't know.

525
00:19:07,140 --> 00:19:08,140
No, the again?

526
00:19:09,140 --> 00:19:10,140
You're not trying to see Who's the Yu who Oh Seul-yoon.

527
00:19:11,140 --> 00:19:13,140
The Mt.

528
00:19:14,140 --> 00:19:15,140
It's not me.

529
00:19:16,140 --> 00:19:17,140
Right.

530
00:19:17,140 --> 00:19:19,140
K Shoot Sign A G emphasis said it would be so embarrassing if I let them love each other.

531
00:19:19,140 --> 00:19:25,440
The

532
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:26,540
That's inappropriate, right?

533
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:31,080
The

534
00:19:31,140 --> 00:19:32,140
Let's become crazy.

535
00:19:32,140 --> 00:19:33,140
Your eyes.

536
00:19:33,140 --> 00:19:35,140
Ah!

537
00:19:35,140 --> 00:19:37,140
Why are you so good at this?

538
00:19:37,140 --> 00:19:39,140
Why are you so good at this?

539
00:19:39,140 --> 00:19:41,140
Ah!

540
00:19:45,140 --> 00:19:47,140
Wait a minute, why are you so good at this?

541
00:19:47,140 --> 00:19:49,140
Why are you so good at this?

542
00:19:49,140 --> 00:19:51,140
We've been doing this together for a long time

543
00:19:51,140 --> 00:19:53,140
and we've become good at it.

544
00:19:53,140 --> 00:19:55,140
Everyone is quick to know.

545
00:19:55,140 --> 00:19:57,140
Who's next?

546
00:19:57,140 --> 00:19:59,140
Snowman!

547
00:19:59,140 --> 00:20:01,140
Because we have to eat the cake, so we have to do it quickly.

548
00:20:01,140 --> 00:20:03,140
We have to do it quickly.

549
00:20:03,140 --> 00:20:05,140
Rock, Scissors, Paper, Shoot!

550
00:20:05,140 --> 00:20:07,140
Rock, Scissors, Paper, Shoot!

551
00:20:07,140 --> 00:20:09,140
Rock, Scissors, Paper, Shoot!

552
00:20:09,140 --> 00:20:11,140
I'm the last one.

553
00:20:13,140 --> 00:20:15,140
Kang Yerin is...

554
00:20:15,140 --> 00:20:17,140
No.

555
00:20:17,140 --> 00:20:19,140
Kang Yerin is...

556
00:20:19,140 --> 00:20:21,140
Let's go!

557
00:20:23,140 --> 00:20:25,140
Kang Yerin is...

558
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:27,140
Please pick the person who you think is the manito of the day.

559
00:20:31,140 --> 00:20:33,140
Wait a minute.

560
00:20:33,140 --> 00:20:35,140
Now...

561
00:20:35,140 --> 00:20:37,140
Min...

562
00:20:37,140 --> 00:20:39,140
Hyein...

563
00:20:39,140 --> 00:20:41,140
Hyein...

564
00:20:41,140 --> 00:20:43,140
Me?

565
00:20:43,140 --> 00:20:45,140
Minji, Hani...

566
00:20:45,140 --> 00:20:47,140
It's important.

567
00:20:47,140 --> 00:20:49,140
It's important.

568
00:20:57,140 --> 00:20:59,140
Hani?

569
00:20:59,140 --> 00:21:01,140
What about Hani?

570
00:21:01,140 --> 00:21:03,140
Hyein?

571
00:21:03,140 --> 00:21:05,140
If you think you're the manito of the day,

572
00:21:05,140 --> 00:21:07,140
please come to the front of the door with a present.

573
00:21:09,140 --> 00:21:11,140
Please close your eyes.

574
00:21:11,140 --> 00:21:13,140
I'm the present.

575
00:21:13,140 --> 00:21:15,140
I'm the present.

576
00:21:15,140 --> 00:21:17,140
Close your eyes.

577
00:21:17,140 --> 00:21:19,140
I'll cover your eyes with this.

578
00:21:19,140 --> 00:21:21,140
I'll cover your eyes with this.

579
00:21:21,140 --> 00:21:23,140
Is your eye there?

580
00:21:23,140 --> 00:21:25,140
What is it?

581
00:21:25,140 --> 00:21:27,140
There's a second eye.

582
00:21:27,140 --> 00:21:29,140
I'm scared.

583
00:21:31,140 --> 00:21:33,140
I'm scared.

584
00:21:35,140 --> 00:21:37,140
What's going on?

585
00:21:37,140 --> 00:21:39,140
You did a great job.

586
00:21:41,140 --> 00:21:43,140
Is it a space sound?

587
00:21:43,140 --> 00:21:45,140
Oh, my God.

588
00:21:45,140 --> 00:21:47,140
What is it?

589
00:21:47,140 --> 00:21:49,140
Oh, that's awesome.

590
00:21:49,140 --> 00:21:51,140
3D sound.

591
00:21:51,140 --> 00:21:53,140
Is that why you're doing this?

592
00:21:53,140 --> 00:21:55,140
No.

593
00:21:55,140 --> 00:21:57,140
It's longer than I thought.

594
00:21:57,140 --> 00:22:01,140
Hyein, open your eyes and check your manito.

595
00:22:11,140 --> 00:22:13,140
You're so funny.

596
00:22:13,140 --> 00:22:15,140
You're so funny.

597
00:22:15,140 --> 00:22:17,140
I showed you my hard work.

598
00:22:17,140 --> 00:22:19,140
I'm so cute.

599
00:22:19,140 --> 00:22:21,140
I'm so cute.

600
00:22:21,140 --> 00:22:23,140
I'm so cute.

601
00:22:23,140 --> 00:22:25,140
I'm so cute.

602
00:22:25,140 --> 00:22:27,140
I'm so pretty.

603
00:22:27,140 --> 00:22:29,140
I'm so serious.

604
00:22:29,140 --> 00:22:31,140
I'm so serious.

605
00:22:31,140 --> 00:22:33,140
I'm so serious.

606
00:22:33,140 --> 00:22:35,140
I'm so serious.

607
00:22:35,140 --> 00:22:37,140
All the drawings are a little bit like a present.

608
00:22:37,140 --> 00:22:39,140
All the drawings are a little bit like a present.

609
00:22:39,140 --> 00:22:41,140
You're so pretty.

610
00:22:41,140 --> 00:22:43,140
I'll hold this for you.

611
00:22:45,140 --> 00:22:47,140
You're so pretty.

612
00:22:47,140 --> 00:22:49,140
Thank you, Pah.

613
00:22:49,140 --> 00:22:51,140
Thank you, Pah.

614
00:22:51,140 --> 00:22:53,140
That's all for you.

615
00:22:53,140 --> 00:22:55,140
You should have seen her painting.

616
00:22:55,140 --> 00:22:57,140
Yeah, I saw it.

617
00:22:57,140 --> 00:22:59,140
And when she's rapping, it's really...

618
00:22:59,140 --> 00:23:01,140
She actually...

619
00:23:01,140 --> 00:23:03,140
It sounded like the people at the store.

620
00:23:03,140 --> 00:23:05,140
Yeah.

621
00:23:05,140 --> 00:23:07,140
She's a rapping pro.

622
00:23:07,140 --> 00:23:09,140
She's so good.

623
00:23:09,140 --> 00:23:11,140
Next.

624
00:23:11,140 --> 00:23:13,140
Pink Rudolph.

625
00:23:13,140 --> 00:23:15,140
What will it be?

626
00:23:15,140 --> 00:23:17,140
Let's start.

627
00:23:17,140 --> 00:23:19,140
Isn't it just one person?

628
00:23:19,140 --> 00:23:21,140
I'll come out too.

629
00:23:21,140 --> 00:23:23,140
Oh?

630
00:23:23,140 --> 00:23:25,140
Okay.

631
00:23:25,140 --> 00:23:27,140
Who do you think is your manito?

632
00:23:27,140 --> 00:23:29,140
Tell me the name.

633
00:23:29,140 --> 00:23:31,140
It's like I'm doing interrogation.

634
00:23:31,140 --> 00:23:33,140
Wait, wait, wait.

635
00:23:33,140 --> 00:23:35,140
Did you do something wrong?

636
00:23:35,140 --> 00:23:37,140
Pink Rudolph.

637
00:23:37,140 --> 00:23:39,140
Hey!

638
00:23:39,140 --> 00:23:41,140
It's fast.

639
00:23:41,140 --> 00:23:43,140
Hey, Yola. What are you doing?

640
00:23:45,140 --> 00:23:47,140
Who am I?

641
00:23:47,140 --> 00:23:49,140
My manito is...

642
00:23:49,140 --> 00:23:51,140
Kang Hyerin and Kim Minji.

643
00:23:51,140 --> 00:23:53,140
Of course.

644
00:23:55,140 --> 00:23:57,140
My manito is...

645
00:23:57,140 --> 00:23:59,140
I'm really...

646
00:23:59,140 --> 00:24:01,140
Kang Hyerin.

647
00:24:01,140 --> 00:24:03,140
I think it's you.

648
00:24:03,140 --> 00:24:05,140
Really?

649
00:24:05,140 --> 00:24:07,140
Really?

650
00:24:07,140 --> 00:24:09,140
Yes.

651
00:24:09,140 --> 00:24:11,140
I don't know.

652
00:24:11,140 --> 00:24:13,140
I think it's right.

653
00:24:13,140 --> 00:24:15,140
Then,

654
00:24:15,140 --> 00:24:17,140
Kang Hyerin,

655
00:24:17,140 --> 00:24:19,140
if you're a manito,

656
00:24:19,140 --> 00:24:21,140
please come out in front of Hyein with a present.

657
00:24:21,140 --> 00:24:23,140
Show up.

658
00:24:23,140 --> 00:24:25,140
I'm your present.

659
00:24:25,140 --> 00:24:27,140
I'm your present.

660
00:24:27,140 --> 00:24:29,140
Please close your eyes.

661
00:24:29,140 --> 00:24:31,140
Here we go.

662
00:24:39,140 --> 00:24:41,140
Hyein, if you're ready,

663
00:24:41,140 --> 00:24:43,140
Please open your eyes and check.

664
00:24:43,140 --> 00:24:45,140
One, two, three.

665
00:24:45,140 --> 00:24:47,140
Is it right?

666
00:24:47,140 --> 00:24:49,140
How did you guess it all?

667
00:24:49,140 --> 00:24:51,140
Wow.

668
00:24:51,140 --> 00:24:53,140
Hyein, are you ready?

669
00:24:53,140 --> 00:24:55,140
Is there any present that isn't here?

670
00:24:55,140 --> 00:24:57,140
Oh, look at the Rudolphs.

671
00:24:57,140 --> 00:24:59,140
They look like choccy milk.

672
00:24:59,140 --> 00:25:01,140
Choccy.

673
00:25:01,140 --> 00:25:03,140
Stoby choccy milk.

674
00:25:03,140 --> 00:25:05,140
I think the wrapping is so pretty.

675
00:25:05,140 --> 00:25:07,140
You're really good at this.

676
00:25:07,140 --> 00:25:09,140
Cute.

677
00:25:09,140 --> 00:25:11,140
I really love this wrapping.

678
00:25:11,140 --> 00:25:13,140
Purple, yellow,

679
00:25:13,140 --> 00:25:15,140
sky blue, and white.

680
00:25:15,140 --> 00:25:17,140
This is Hyein's favorite color.

681
00:25:17,140 --> 00:25:19,140
It's so cute.

682
00:25:19,140 --> 00:25:21,140
Did you do it yourself?

683
00:25:21,140 --> 00:25:23,140
Okay.

684
00:25:23,140 --> 00:25:25,140
For a pretty wrapping.

685
00:25:25,140 --> 00:25:27,140
Last.

686
00:25:27,140 --> 00:25:29,140
Wow.

687
00:25:29,140 --> 00:25:31,140
I want you to know.

688
00:25:31,140 --> 00:25:33,140
Let it snow again.

689
00:25:33,140 --> 00:25:35,140
Stop it.

690
00:25:35,140 --> 00:25:37,140
I'm not watching.

691
00:25:37,140 --> 00:25:39,140
Okay.

692
00:25:39,140 --> 00:25:41,140
HANI, please point out the person

693
00:25:41,140 --> 00:25:43,140
you think is your favorite.

694
00:25:43,140 --> 00:25:45,140
Please point out the person you think is your favorite.

695
00:25:45,140 --> 00:25:47,140
Yes, please.

696
00:25:47,140 --> 00:25:49,140
To be honest,

697
00:25:49,140 --> 00:25:51,140
I'm the last one.

698
00:25:51,140 --> 00:25:53,140
I'm the last one.

699
00:25:53,140 --> 00:25:55,140
I'm the last one.

700
00:25:55,140 --> 00:25:57,140
I'm the last one.

701
00:25:57,140 --> 00:25:59,140
To be honest,

702
00:25:59,140 --> 00:26:01,140
I'm the last one.

703
00:26:01,140 --> 00:26:03,140
That's why I'm the last.

704
00:26:03,140 --> 00:26:05,140
Who do you think is the last one?

705
00:26:05,140 --> 00:26:07,140
Who do you think is the last one?

706
00:26:07,140 --> 00:26:09,140
So I...

707
00:26:13,140 --> 00:26:15,140
And...

708
00:26:15,140 --> 00:26:17,140
A few days ago,

709
00:26:17,140 --> 00:26:19,140
I saw something on HANI.

710
00:26:19,140 --> 00:26:21,140
Oh, you got a little too obvious.

711
00:26:21,140 --> 00:26:23,140
Me?

712
00:26:23,140 --> 00:26:25,140
What did you do?

713
00:26:25,140 --> 00:26:27,140
Really?

714
00:26:27,140 --> 00:26:29,140
I got it!

715
00:26:29,140 --> 00:26:31,140
Hey you!

716
00:26:31,140 --> 00:26:33,140
What are you doing to your Marido?

717
00:26:33,140 --> 00:26:35,140
What did I do?

718
00:26:35,140 --> 00:26:37,140
What did I do?

719
00:26:37,140 --> 00:26:39,140
What did I do?

720
00:26:39,140 --> 00:26:41,140
It was too hard.

721
00:26:41,140 --> 00:26:43,140
What did I do?

722
00:26:43,140 --> 00:26:45,140
Pony said, I'm ready for Marido.

723
00:26:45,140 --> 00:26:47,140
I wrote down the name of the brand.

724
00:26:47,140 --> 00:26:49,140
But it wasn't a letter.

725
00:26:49,140 --> 00:26:51,140
It was a hyphen.

726
00:26:51,140 --> 00:26:53,140
It was a hyphen.

727
00:26:53,140 --> 00:26:55,140
I didn't do it.

728
00:26:55,140 --> 00:26:57,140
Huh?

729
00:26:57,140 --> 00:26:59,140
No, you didn't.

730
00:26:59,140 --> 00:27:01,140
Sanita's lie.

731
00:27:01,140 --> 00:27:03,140
Are there two Santas?

732
00:27:03,140 --> 00:27:05,140
I did it.

733
00:27:05,140 --> 00:27:07,140
See you later.

734
00:27:07,140 --> 00:27:09,140
But the camera is like,

735
00:27:09,140 --> 00:27:11,140
Me?

736
00:27:11,140 --> 00:27:13,140
Me?

737
00:27:13,140 --> 00:27:15,140
Anyway, it's out.

738
00:27:19,140 --> 00:27:21,140
We can't hear you now.

739
00:27:21,140 --> 00:27:23,140
We can't hear you.

740
00:27:23,140 --> 00:27:25,140
But I'm going to open it.

741
00:27:27,140 --> 00:27:29,140
Please open your eyes and check it.

742
00:27:29,140 --> 00:27:31,140
Open your eyes.

743
00:27:31,140 --> 00:27:33,140
Ta-da.

744
00:27:33,140 --> 00:27:35,140
Isn't the package so cute?

745
00:27:35,140 --> 00:27:37,140
It's like a Millimia.

746
00:27:37,140 --> 00:27:39,140
Don't show it to the side.

747
00:27:39,140 --> 00:27:41,140
I did my best.

748
00:27:41,140 --> 00:27:43,140
I think you're lacking in the packaging.

749
00:27:43,140 --> 00:27:45,140
No, I wasn't lacking.

750
00:27:45,140 --> 00:27:47,140
This was my best.

751
00:27:47,140 --> 00:27:49,140
I love the tape.

752
00:27:49,140 --> 00:27:51,140
It's the tape for the bar.

753
00:27:51,140 --> 00:27:53,140
It's the tape for the bar.

754
00:27:53,140 --> 00:27:55,140
It's so obvious.

755
00:27:55,140 --> 00:27:57,140
I did my best.

756
00:27:57,140 --> 00:27:59,140
Why? I didn't like it.

757
00:27:59,140 --> 00:28:01,140
So you bought the tape a while ago.

758
00:28:01,140 --> 00:28:03,140
Who bought it?

759
00:28:03,140 --> 00:28:05,140
Oh.

760
00:28:05,140 --> 00:28:07,140
It's all revealed.

761
00:28:07,140 --> 00:28:09,140
No, I did it.

762
00:28:11,140 --> 00:28:13,140
Don't look.

763
00:28:13,140 --> 00:28:15,140
Santa Claus is...

764
00:28:15,140 --> 00:28:17,140
Santa Claus is beating Rudolph.

765
00:28:17,140 --> 00:28:19,140
Santa Claus is beating Rudolph.

766
00:28:19,140 --> 00:28:21,140
Santa Claus is beating Rudolph.

767
00:28:21,140 --> 00:28:23,140
Do you think it makes sense?

768
00:28:23,140 --> 00:28:25,140
I don't know.

769
00:28:25,140 --> 00:28:27,140
I'm just looking forward to it.

770
00:28:27,140 --> 00:28:29,140
Let's see the broadcast.

771
00:28:29,140 --> 00:28:31,140
Oh, my God.

772
00:28:31,140 --> 00:28:33,140
Oh, my God.

773
00:28:33,140 --> 00:28:35,140
Oh, my God.

774
00:28:35,140 --> 00:28:37,140
Oh, my God.

775
00:28:37,140 --> 00:28:39,140
Oh, my God.

776
00:28:39,140 --> 00:28:41,140
Oh, my God.

777
00:28:41,140 --> 00:28:43,140
Oh, my God.

778
00:28:43,140 --> 00:28:45,140
Oh, my God.

779
00:28:45,140 --> 00:28:47,140
Oh, my God.

780
00:28:47,140 --> 00:28:49,140
Oh, my God.

781
00:28:49,140 --> 00:28:51,140
Oh, my God.

782
00:28:51,140 --> 00:28:53,140
Wait, I need to put the wrapper over the way.

783
00:28:53,140 --> 00:28:55,140
I understood you, but I don't think it makes sense.

784
00:28:55,140 --> 00:28:57,140
I see.

785
00:28:57,140 --> 00:28:59,140
I'm weak, and I'm making noise cause I heard you.

786
00:28:59,140 --> 00:29:01,140
I heard you were taking a walk.

787
00:29:01,140 --> 00:29:03,140
I was so seems fine.

788
00:29:03,140 --> 00:29:05,140
I didn't do it because I really thought you did well.

789
00:29:05,140 --> 00:29:07,140
Usually.

790
00:29:07,140 --> 00:29:09,140
But I put the pack in a lot too much.

791
00:29:09,140 --> 00:29:11,140
We followed the direction.

792
00:29:11,140 --> 00:29:13,140
You don't have to say anything.

793
00:29:13,140 --> 00:29:14,140
contarou

794
00:29:14,140 --> 00:29:16,140
I also sighted it.

795
00:29:16,140 --> 00:29:18,140
Oh?

796
00:29:18,140 --> 00:29:19,140
charge

797
00:29:19,140 --> 00:29:22,140
It's so cute even now.

798
00:29:22,140 --> 00:29:24,140
It's like a red wrapping paper inside.

799
00:29:24,140 --> 00:29:26,140
I know how hard you worked on it.

800
00:29:26,140 --> 00:29:28,140
Thank you.

801
00:29:28,140 --> 00:29:31,140
Let's hurry up and eat the cake.

802
00:29:31,140 --> 00:29:33,140
I like wrapping.

803
00:29:33,140 --> 00:29:36,140
I like wrapping.

804
00:29:36,140 --> 00:29:40,140
Honestly, I care about that.

805
00:29:40,140 --> 00:29:43,140
It's not like that after wrapping.

806
00:29:43,140 --> 00:29:45,140
It's not like that after wrapping.

807
00:29:45,140 --> 00:29:47,140
No, I need my gloves.

808
00:29:47,140 --> 00:29:49,140
Open it.

809
00:29:49,140 --> 00:29:50,140
Okay.

810
00:29:50,140 --> 00:29:52,140
Give my money to glass.

811
00:29:55,140 --> 00:29:56,140
I'm looking forward to it.

812
00:29:56,140 --> 00:29:58,140
Where did everyone go?

813
00:29:58,140 --> 00:30:00,140
They went behind the snow.

814
00:30:02,140 --> 00:30:04,140
Rudolph's eyes are too big.

815
00:30:04,140 --> 00:30:05,140
Santa, get down.

816
00:30:05,140 --> 00:30:06,140
Hey, Santa, what are you doing?

817
00:30:06,140 --> 00:30:07,140
It's dangerous.

818
00:30:07,140 --> 00:30:08,140
It's a weird Santa.

819
00:30:08,140 --> 00:30:10,140
This is the weirdest Santa.

820
00:30:10,140 --> 00:30:12,140
It's Rudolph.

821
00:30:12,140 --> 00:30:16,140
It's a gift to everyone in the world.

822
00:30:16,140 --> 00:30:17,140
Hand Santa.

823
00:30:17,140 --> 00:30:19,140
It's a gift to everyone in the world.

824
00:30:19,140 --> 00:30:20,140
It's a gift to everyone in the world.

825
00:30:20,140 --> 00:30:21,140
It's a gift to everyone in the world.

826
00:30:21,140 --> 00:30:25,140
Oh, my name was erased just now.

827
00:30:25,140 --> 00:30:26,140
What?

828
00:30:26,140 --> 00:30:27,140
What?

829
00:30:27,140 --> 00:30:29,140
What?

830
00:30:29,140 --> 00:30:31,140
Now, behind the Morani.

831
00:30:31,140 --> 00:30:34,140
Why do I like it so much?

832
00:30:34,140 --> 00:30:36,140
Behind the Morani.

833
00:30:36,140 --> 00:30:38,140
Morani, Morani.

834
00:30:41,140 --> 00:30:42,140
They want us to change the music.

835
00:30:42,140 --> 00:30:44,140
Okay, we'll change the music.

836
00:30:45,140 --> 00:30:46,140
It's so cute.

837
00:30:46,140 --> 00:30:48,140
Let's change the music.

838
00:30:48,140 --> 00:30:49,140
Wait, let's change the music.

839
00:30:49,140 --> 00:30:51,140
I'll go with what I want.

840
00:30:51,140 --> 00:30:52,140
What?

841
00:30:52,140 --> 00:30:53,140
You play hip hop.

842
00:30:53,140 --> 00:30:58,140
I just want you.

843
00:30:58,140 --> 00:31:00,140
Dance party before Hyerin arrives.

844
00:31:00,140 --> 00:31:02,140
I think I need to go wash and come back.

845
00:31:02,140 --> 00:31:03,140
Okay.

846
00:31:03,140 --> 00:31:05,140
Go shower and come back.

847
00:31:05,140 --> 00:31:07,140
Rudolph will go wash and come back.

848
00:31:07,140 --> 00:31:09,140
There will be a dance party.

849
00:31:09,140 --> 00:31:10,140
Done.

850
00:31:10,140 --> 00:31:12,140
Oh, I'm going to go.

851
00:31:13,140 --> 00:31:14,140
Who will come?

852
00:31:14,140 --> 00:31:19,140
Eui- arrange the stage

853
00:31:19,140 --> 00:31:23,140
Just do what you want, say what you want

854
00:31:27,140 --> 00:31:29,140
Oh, there's a mood

855
00:31:41,140 --> 00:31:42,140
Emotional

856
00:31:42,140 --> 00:31:44,140
They're not kidding

857
00:31:44,140 --> 00:31:45,140
Go, Frieza, Frieza, go, Rudolph, go

858
00:31:45,140 --> 00:31:47,140
Pop off Rudolph, let's go

859
00:31:49,140 --> 00:31:50,140
Wow

860
00:32:02,140 --> 00:32:04,140
Go, go, go, Frieza, Pop off Rudolph

861
00:32:06,140 --> 00:32:08,140
This is the place, right?

862
00:32:09,140 --> 00:32:10,140
I can't open it

863
00:32:10,140 --> 00:32:11,140
I can't open it

864
00:32:14,140 --> 00:32:15,140
Maniac

865
00:32:16,140 --> 00:32:18,140
I want to open it quickly

866
00:32:18,140 --> 00:32:19,140
Chaerin, you're the best

867
00:32:19,140 --> 00:32:20,140
But is it okay?

868
00:32:20,140 --> 00:32:21,140
It's okay

869
00:32:21,140 --> 00:32:23,140
Rudolph's eyes are too big

870
00:32:23,140 --> 00:32:24,140
I keep getting it

871
00:32:24,140 --> 00:32:28,140
Rudolph's eyes are too big

872
00:32:31,140 --> 00:32:34,140
Everyone, did you make a snowman this year?

873
00:32:34,140 --> 00:32:35,140
No

874
00:32:37,140 --> 00:32:38,140
Did you meet Santa?

875
00:32:38,140 --> 00:32:39,140
One, two, three

876
00:32:39,140 --> 00:32:40,140
I made it

877
00:32:40,140 --> 00:32:41,140
Get out of here

878
00:32:41,140 --> 00:32:42,140
I made it

879
00:32:42,140 --> 00:32:43,140
I'm Chaerin

880
00:32:43,140 --> 00:32:45,140
Everyone, this is the snowman I made

881
00:32:45,140 --> 00:32:46,140
Can you see it?

882
00:32:46,140 --> 00:32:48,140
If you look here, it's white

883
00:32:48,140 --> 00:32:49,140
I made a scarf here

884
00:32:49,140 --> 00:32:50,140
Here's a button

885
00:32:50,140 --> 00:32:51,140
If you touch it, it makes sense

886
00:32:51,140 --> 00:32:52,140
It's done

887
00:32:54,140 --> 00:32:55,140
Is it a tiger?

888
00:33:01,140 --> 00:33:02,140
You know that

889
00:33:02,140 --> 00:33:03,140
Can I say this?

890
00:33:03,140 --> 00:33:05,140
It's really funny

891
00:33:05,140 --> 00:33:07,140
You know the dancing sauna

892
00:33:07,140 --> 00:33:09,140
I keep saying it

893
00:33:09,140 --> 00:33:10,140
I kept repeating it

894
00:33:10,140 --> 00:33:11,140
I did it like a candy

895
00:33:11,140 --> 00:33:12,140
I'm going to show you later

896
00:33:12,140 --> 00:33:14,140
I want to show you

897
00:33:14,140 --> 00:33:16,140
I'll show you my makeup

898
00:33:16,140 --> 00:33:17,140
I'll show you

899
00:33:17,140 --> 00:33:19,340
I did it like a candy.

900
00:33:19,340 --> 00:33:20,540
Like a Christmas candy.

901
00:33:20,540 --> 00:33:21,140
Good.

902
00:33:21,140 --> 00:33:23,140
It's really cute.

903
00:33:23,140 --> 00:33:24,140
I'll show you.

904
00:33:31,940 --> 00:33:34,140
This is like a candy.

905
00:33:34,140 --> 00:33:35,140
And...

906
00:33:35,140 --> 00:33:37,140
Thanks, girl.

907
00:33:37,140 --> 00:33:40,140
The bottom one is pink.

908
00:33:40,140 --> 00:33:42,140
Wait, behind you.

909
00:33:47,140 --> 00:33:49,140
It's really pretty.

910
00:33:49,140 --> 00:33:52,140
I really like this remix.

911
00:34:13,140 --> 00:34:14,140
Why?

912
00:34:14,140 --> 00:34:16,140
Rudolph number 3 is back.

913
00:34:16,140 --> 00:34:17,140
Woo!

914
00:34:17,140 --> 00:34:18,140
Okay.

915
00:34:18,140 --> 00:34:19,140
Yeah.

916
00:34:19,140 --> 00:34:20,140
Let's turn on the...

917
00:34:20,140 --> 00:34:22,140
Do you like it on or off?

918
00:34:22,140 --> 00:34:23,140
I'll look at my face.

919
00:34:23,140 --> 00:34:24,140
It's a bit moody.

920
00:34:24,140 --> 00:34:25,140
Which one is prettier?

921
00:34:27,140 --> 00:34:28,140
I like this one.

922
00:34:28,140 --> 00:34:31,140
It's pretty now, so let's turn off the lights.

923
00:34:31,140 --> 00:34:32,140
Let's go.

924
00:34:32,140 --> 00:34:33,140
Let's go with a light mood.

925
00:34:33,140 --> 00:34:34,140
Spotlight.

926
00:34:34,140 --> 00:34:35,140
Empty light.

927
00:34:35,140 --> 00:34:36,140
All right, let's go.

928
00:34:36,140 --> 00:34:37,140
Spotlight.

929
00:34:37,140 --> 00:34:38,140
You're good.

930
00:34:38,140 --> 00:34:39,140
Yeah.

931
00:34:39,140 --> 00:34:40,140
How do I do this?

932
00:34:40,140 --> 00:34:41,140
Like this?

933
00:34:41,140 --> 00:34:42,140
Like this.

934
00:34:42,140 --> 00:34:43,140
Pink Rudolph.

935
00:34:43,140 --> 00:34:45,140
You can stop the stage.

936
00:34:45,140 --> 00:34:46,140
Okay.

937
00:34:46,140 --> 00:34:47,140
No.

938
00:34:48,140 --> 00:34:49,140
Come on.

939
00:34:49,140 --> 00:34:50,140
Your А Morgen D reckon is pretty.

940
00:34:51,140 --> 00:34:52,140
Turn on the light on.

941
00:34:52,140 --> 00:34:53,140
Don't turn off.

942
00:34:53,140 --> 00:34:54,140
The light Christine.

943
00:34:54,140 --> 00:34:55,140
Why are you steel relaxâ?

944
00:34:55,140 --> 00:34:56,140
shoulder-button please

945
00:34:56,140 --> 00:34:57,140
guiding the light

946
00:34:57,140 --> 00:34:58,140
Oh!

947
00:34:58,140 --> 00:34:59,140
Fine.

948
00:34:59,140 --> 00:35:00,140
Take your clothes back.

949
00:35:00,140 --> 00:35:01,140
You're not the only one.

950
00:35:01,140 --> 00:35:02,140
Not that.

951
00:35:02,140 --> 00:35:03,140
Mm.

952
00:35:03,140 --> 00:35:04,140
Oh!

953
00:35:04,140 --> 00:35:05,140
The cotton wool that I'm in...

954
00:35:05,140 --> 00:35:06,140
Oh!

955
00:35:06,140 --> 00:35:07,140
Hani is here too.

956
00:35:07,140 --> 00:35:08,140
You're here too.

957
00:35:08,140 --> 00:35:09,140

958
00:35:09,140 --> 00:35:10,140

959
00:35:10,140 --> 00:35:11,140
Oh!

962
00:35:13,140 --> 00:35:14,140
Open the lid.

963
00:35:14,140 --> 00:35:15,140
Why do I go there?

964
00:35:15,140 --> 00:35:16,140
Why don't I go with her?

965
00:35:16,140 --> 00:35:17,140
Oh, gosh!

966
00:35:17,140 --> 00:35:18,140
It's Papa!

967
00:35:18,140 --> 00:35:19,140
That's right.

968
00:35:19,140 --> 00:35:20,140
It's so cute.

969
00:35:20,140 --> 00:35:21,140
I love this ribbon.

970
00:35:21,140 --> 00:35:24,140
It'll take an hour to get used to it.

971
00:35:24,140 --> 00:35:25,140
Oh, my.

972
00:35:25,140 --> 00:35:26,140
You look like a sister.

973
00:35:26,140 --> 00:35:27,140
Oh, my.

974
00:35:27,140 --> 00:35:28,140
You're so pretty.

975
00:35:28,140 --> 00:35:29,140
You're so pretty.

976
00:35:29,140 --> 00:35:30,140
I can tell.

977
00:35:30,140 --> 00:35:31,140
You look like a sister.

978
00:35:31,140 --> 00:35:32,140
Oh, my.

979
00:35:32,140 --> 00:35:33,140
You have one more layer.

980
00:35:33,140 --> 00:35:34,140
Oh, my.

981
00:35:34,140 --> 00:35:35,140
There's more.

982
00:35:35,140 --> 00:35:36,140
I think I know what this is.

983
00:35:36,140 --> 00:35:37,140
You're a sister.

984
00:35:37,140 --> 00:35:38,140
You're a sister.

985
00:35:38,140 --> 00:35:39,140
Why are you acting like you don't know?

986
00:35:39,140 --> 00:35:40,140
Actually, she couldn't pack it.

987
00:35:40,140 --> 00:35:41,140
Why?

988
00:35:41,140 --> 00:35:42,140
Pack it like this.

989
00:35:42,140 --> 00:35:43,140
What?

990
00:35:43,140 --> 00:35:44,140
It's a cup.

991
00:35:44,140 --> 00:35:45,140
It's a cup.

992
00:35:45,140 --> 00:35:46,140
It's a cup, right?

993
00:35:46,140 --> 00:35:47,140
No.

994
00:35:47,140 --> 00:35:48,140
You're a sister.

995
00:35:48,140 --> 00:35:51,140
What I want to say is that I heard Dan-ie's songs a lot last year.

996
00:35:51,140 --> 00:35:52,140
Oh, no.

997
00:35:52,140 --> 00:35:55,140
So I originally wanted to give this to you last year.

998
00:35:55,140 --> 00:35:59,140
So I want to give it to you last year.

999
00:35:59,140 --> 00:36:00,140
But it's all-round design.

1000
00:36:00,140 --> 00:36:01,140
Yeah, you remember what you said.

1001
00:36:01,140 --> 00:36:02,140
But it's not all-round Christmas this time.

1002
00:36:02,140 --> 00:36:03,140
But it's cute.

1003
00:36:03,140 --> 00:36:04,140
It's all-round.

1004
00:36:04,140 --> 00:36:05,140
But it's cute.

1005
00:36:05,140 --> 00:36:06,140
So what kind of design does it have?

1006
00:36:06,140 --> 00:36:07,140
It's all-round.

1007
00:36:07,140 --> 00:36:08,140
It's all-round.

1008
00:36:08,140 --> 00:36:09,140
It's all-round.

1009
00:36:09,140 --> 00:36:10,140
It's all-round.

1010
00:36:10,140 --> 00:36:11,140
I got it, Dan-ie.

1011
00:36:11,140 --> 00:36:12,140
Oh, my.

1012
00:36:12,140 --> 00:36:13,140
I got it, Dan-ie.

1013
00:36:13,140 --> 00:36:14,140
It's all-round.

1014
00:36:14,140 --> 00:36:16,540
I didn't know this was on the site

1015
00:36:16,540 --> 00:36:18,880
You like to give gifts to your sister, right?

1016
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:19,780
I'll stop here

1017
00:36:19,780 --> 00:36:20,640
I always give gifts

1018
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:22,140
I'm really good at explaining

1019
00:36:22,140 --> 00:36:24,440
It's a little pot

1020
00:36:24,440 --> 00:36:28,240
It's a plant, plant pot

1021
00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:29,240
Really?

1022
00:36:29,240 --> 00:36:30,280
Bring it back, girl

1023
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:32,240
Ta-da, a rabbit

1024
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:33,440
Oh my god

1025
00:36:35,640 --> 00:36:38,040
So cute

1026
00:36:38,040 --> 00:36:39,940
Oh my god

1027
00:36:39,940 --> 00:36:40,940
Show it here

1028
00:36:40,940 --> 00:36:44,440
You can grow it

1029
00:36:44,440 --> 00:36:46,940
You can plant whatever you want

1030
00:36:46,940 --> 00:36:49,440
Small ones, like a fertilizer

1031
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:51,940
I was going to buy a fertilizer

1032
00:36:51,940 --> 00:36:53,940
But I didn't have time, I'm sorry

1033
00:36:53,940 --> 00:36:55,340
So cute

1034
00:36:55,340 --> 00:36:56,940
I love you

1035
00:36:56,940 --> 00:36:58,940
But there are two more left

1036
00:36:58,940 --> 00:37:00,140
I love you more and more

1037
00:37:00,140 --> 00:37:01,440
So cute

1038
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:03,740
Okay, quickly

1039
00:37:03,740 --> 00:37:05,340
Number 1

1040
00:37:05,340 --> 00:37:06,440
I have to set it up

1041
00:37:06,440 --> 00:37:08,240
It's so cute

1042
00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:09,440
Oh my gosh, what is it?

1043
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:10,540
This was bought in Japan

1044
00:37:11,540 --> 00:37:13,040
I went with Hani

1045
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:15,340
Oh my gosh, this is so cute

1046
00:37:15,340 --> 00:37:16,140
But the funny thing is

1047
00:37:16,140 --> 00:37:18,040
While we were giving gifts to many people

1048
00:37:18,040 --> 00:37:18,540
Amazing

1049
00:37:18,540 --> 00:37:19,340
Who did you show?

1050
00:37:19,340 --> 00:37:20,540
Many, many

1051
00:37:20,540 --> 00:37:22,540
Please show us this

1052
00:37:22,540 --> 00:37:23,540
This is here

1053
00:37:23,540 --> 00:37:27,540
There are many crabs, water and pottery in the shop

1054
00:37:27,540 --> 00:37:29,040
I love this

1055
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:30,040
Oh

1056
00:37:32,040 --> 00:37:33,040
Santa

1057
00:37:34,040 --> 00:37:38,040
Santa, is you really there?

1058
00:37:39,540 --> 00:37:40,040
No

1059
00:37:40,540 --> 00:37:41,540
But it looks so cute

1060
00:37:41,540 --> 00:37:43,540
So I thought you would like it

1061
00:37:43,540 --> 00:37:44,540
Thank you

1062
00:37:44,540 --> 00:37:46,540
Suga, look at this

1063
00:37:46,540 --> 00:37:48,540
Her face is really no joke

1064
00:37:48,540 --> 00:37:49,540
This is a hole

1065
00:37:49,540 --> 00:37:50,540
No joke

1066
00:37:50,540 --> 00:37:51,540
Touch it, Santa

1067
00:37:51,540 --> 00:37:52,540
No, this is

1068
00:37:52,540 --> 00:37:53,540
It's for raising a child

1069
00:37:53,540 --> 00:37:55,040
Is there a hole?

1070
00:37:55,040 --> 00:37:56,040
Yes

1071
00:37:56,040 --> 00:37:57,540
I don't know how to raise it

1072
00:37:57,540 --> 00:37:59,540
But she did it

1073
00:37:59,540 --> 00:38:02,540
This one is also cute and cute

1074
00:38:02,540 --> 00:38:04,540
You know me so well

1075
00:38:04,540 --> 00:38:06,540
You're so pretty

1076
00:38:06,540 --> 00:38:07,540
You know me so well

1077
00:38:07,540 --> 00:38:09,540
Please show this pretty too

1078
00:38:09,540 --> 00:38:10,540
This is so cute

1079
00:38:10,540 --> 00:38:11,540
This is a real

00:38:11,540 --> 00:38:12,540
This is a real

1081
00:38:12,540 --> 00:38:13,540
No

1082
00:38:13,540 --> 00:38:14,540
No

1083
00:38:14,540 --> 00:38:15,540
No

1084
00:38:15,540 --> 00:38:16,540
No, no, no

1085
00:38:16,540 --> 00:38:17,540
No, no, no

1086
00:38:17,540 --> 00:38:18,540
Go

1087
00:38:18,540 --> 00:38:19,540
Go

1088
00:38:22,540 --> 00:38:23,540
Isn't it pretty?

1089
00:38:23,540 --> 00:38:25,540
Oh my gosh, that's so cute

1090
00:38:25,540 --> 00:38:26,540
It's so pretty

1091
00:38:26,540 --> 00:38:27,540
Really

1092
00:38:27,540 --> 00:38:28,540
Is it a cat o'clock?

1093
00:38:28,540 --> 00:38:29,540
What's this package?

1094
00:38:29,540 --> 00:38:31,540
This is a completely dry

1095
00:38:31,540 --> 00:38:32,540
I did it

1096
00:38:32,540 --> 00:38:33,540
It's so pretty

1097
00:38:33,540 --> 00:38:34,540
It's so pretty

1098
00:38:34,540 --> 00:38:35,540
It's so pretty

1099
00:38:35,540 --> 00:38:36,540
It's so pretty

1100
00:38:36,540 --> 00:38:37,540
Where did you get this?

1101
00:38:37,540 --> 00:38:38,540
Here

1102
00:38:39,540 --> 00:38:42,540
Oh my gosh, you're so good at rapping

1103
00:38:45,540 --> 00:38:47,540
So cute

1104
00:38:47,540 --> 00:38:48,540
What should I do with this?

1105
00:38:48,540 --> 00:38:52,540
You failed to buy mushroom lighting last time

1106
00:38:52,540 --> 00:38:53,540
Right

1107
00:38:53,540 --> 00:38:56,540
But I bought this last year

1108
00:38:56,540 --> 00:38:57,540
Oh, this wasn't a knife

1109
00:38:57,540 --> 00:38:59,540
I bought it to use it

1110
00:38:59,540 --> 00:39:01,540
But there are four colors

1111
00:39:01,540 --> 00:39:04,540
There's something that looks so good on you

1112
00:39:04,540 --> 00:39:05,540
It's a set with mine

1113
00:39:05,540 --> 00:39:06,540
Mine is light purple

1114
00:39:06,540 --> 00:39:08,540
Yours is mint

1115
00:39:08,540 --> 00:39:09,540
Yours is a couple

1116
00:39:09,540 --> 00:39:10,540
Oh, definitely

1117
00:39:11,540 --> 00:39:13,540
The入 말完了

1118
00:39:13,540 --> 00:39:14,540
Isn't this the sky color?

1119
00:39:14,540 --> 00:39:15,540
It's a bit shine

1120
00:39:15,540 --> 00:39:16,540
Jesus

1121
00:39:16,540 --> 00:39:17,540
Light blue, sky blue

1122
00:39:17,540 --> 00:39:18,540
Wow

1123
00:39:18,540 --> 00:39:19,540

1124
00:39:20,540 --> 00:39:21,540
You look so good

1125
00:39:21,540 --> 00:39:22,540
Like this

1126
00:39:22,540 --> 00:39:23,540
Mushroom passport that will go to the sky

1127
00:39:25,540 --> 00:39:26,540
Oh my god

1128
00:39:26,540 --> 00:39:27,540
Oh my god

1129
00:39:30,540 --> 00:39:31,540

00:39:32,540 --> 00:39:34,540

00:39:38,540 --> 00:39:40,540
Thank you so much.

00:39:40,540 --> 00:39:42,540
So cute. Oh my god.

1136
00:39:42,540 --> 00:39:44,540
Oh my god.

1137
00:39:44,540 --> 00:39:46,540
And thumbs up. They're all over the place.

1138
00:39:46,540 --> 00:39:48,540
This one.

1139
00:39:48,540 --> 00:39:50,540
So cute.

1140
00:39:50,540 --> 00:39:52,540
I really like this kind of thing.

1141
00:39:52,540 --> 00:39:54,540
Right. It was just like that.

1142
00:39:54,540 --> 00:39:56,540
They said cute.

1143
00:39:56,540 --> 00:39:58,540
I bought a prettier one than I expected.

1144
00:39:58,540 --> 00:40:00,540
I was a little surprised.

1145
00:40:00,540 --> 00:40:02,540
I was touched.

1146
00:40:02,540 --> 00:40:04,540
Who wants to open it?

1147
00:40:04,540 --> 00:40:06,540
I want to open it.

1148
00:40:06,540 --> 00:40:08,540
Okay.

1149
00:40:08,540 --> 00:40:10,540
We always organize it later.

1150
00:40:10,540 --> 00:40:12,540
Okay.

1151
00:40:12,540 --> 00:40:14,540
So cute.

1152
00:40:14,540 --> 00:40:16,540
Thank you.

1153
00:40:16,540 --> 00:40:18,540
Who was the last one?

1154
00:40:18,540 --> 00:40:20,540
Dani.

1155
00:40:20,540 --> 00:40:22,540
Fast.

1156
00:40:22,540 --> 00:40:24,540
Dani is so good at wrapping things.

1157
00:40:24,540 --> 00:40:26,540
So cute.

1158
00:40:26,540 --> 00:40:28,540
You saw it earlier.

1159
00:40:28,540 --> 00:40:30,540
I can't do this size.

1160
00:40:34,540 --> 00:40:36,540
Oh my.

1161
00:40:36,540 --> 00:40:38,540
I thought your face would look like that.

1162
00:40:38,540 --> 00:40:40,540
Your cute face.

1163
00:40:40,540 --> 00:40:42,540
You got the perfect dance.

1164
00:40:42,540 --> 00:40:44,540
I'm going to open these cute things in my room.

1165
00:40:44,540 --> 00:40:46,540
Is it random?

1166
00:40:46,540 --> 00:40:48,540
It's random.

1167
00:40:48,540 --> 00:40:50,540
Which one do you want to get?

1168
00:40:50,540 --> 00:40:52,540
Oh.

1169
00:40:52,540 --> 00:40:54,540
Oh.

1170
00:40:54,540 --> 00:40:56,540
I like all of them.

1171
00:40:56,540 --> 00:40:58,540
I want to eat all of them.

1172
00:40:58,540 --> 00:41:00,540
I'm choosing one of these.

1173
00:41:00,540 --> 00:41:02,540
I'm going to open this.

1174
00:41:02,540 --> 00:41:04,540
I'm going to open this.

1175
00:41:04,540 --> 00:41:06,540
I'm going to open this.

1176
00:41:06,540 --> 00:41:08,540
One, two, three.

1177
00:41:08,540 --> 00:41:10,540
Oh my god.

1178
00:41:10,540 --> 00:41:12,540
It's like you.

1179
00:41:14,540 --> 00:41:16,540
Wow, touch this.

1180
00:41:16,540 --> 00:41:18,540
I want to touch this.

1181
00:41:18,540 --> 00:41:20,540
It's so cute.

1182
00:41:20,540 --> 00:41:22,540
It's like a noodle.

1183
00:41:22,540 --> 00:41:24,540
I think I can feel it.

1184
00:41:24,540 --> 00:41:26,540
If you go to my room today, you'll find it.

1185
00:41:26,540 --> 00:41:28,540
I like it.

1186
00:41:28,540 --> 00:41:30,540
I like it.

1187
00:41:30,540 --> 00:41:32,540
What's next?

1188
00:41:32,540 --> 00:41:34,540
It's all packed.

1189
00:41:34,540 --> 00:41:36,540
It's all packed.

1190
00:41:36,540 --> 00:41:38,540
I made this bread.

1191
00:41:38,540 --> 00:41:40,540
Because we didn't have enough tape.

1192
00:41:40,540 --> 00:41:42,540
We didn't have enough tape.

1193
00:41:42,540 --> 00:41:44,540
So I made it.

1194
00:41:44,540 --> 00:41:46,540
Why did I get this?

1195
00:41:46,540 --> 00:41:48,540
I might get it.

1196
00:41:48,540 --> 00:41:50,540
I got spoiled.

1197
00:41:50,540 --> 00:41:52,540
I got this at school.

1198
00:41:52,540 --> 00:41:54,540
What's this?

1199
00:41:54,540 --> 00:41:56,540
Rudolph's cute shoes.

1200
00:41:56,540 --> 00:41:58,540
What is this?

1201
00:41:58,540 --> 00:42:00,540
Oh, little bear candle.

1202
00:42:00,540 --> 00:42:02,540
It smelled really good.

1203
00:42:02,540 --> 00:42:04,540
I put it in my room.

1204
00:42:04,540 --> 00:42:06,540
It smells good.

1205
00:42:06,540 --> 00:42:08,540
It's so cute.

1206
00:42:10,540 --> 00:42:12,540
You don't have to open it now.

1207
00:42:12,540 --> 00:42:14,540
Minji, you don't want to open it?

1208
00:42:14,540 --> 00:42:16,540
No, please open it.

1209
00:42:16,540 --> 00:42:18,540
Because this is the point.

1210
00:42:18,540 --> 00:42:20,540
I have so many of these.

1211
00:42:20,540 --> 00:42:22,540
I put them in front of my room.

1212
00:42:22,540 --> 00:42:24,540
It's been unboxed.

1213
00:42:24,540 --> 00:42:26,540
Oh my god.

1214
00:42:26,540 --> 00:42:28,540
This is a candle that can really burn.

1215
00:42:28,540 --> 00:42:30,540
You know what I mean?

1216
00:42:30,540 --> 00:42:32,540
I thought it would smell sweet.

1217
00:42:32,540 --> 00:42:34,540
But it's not sweet.

1218
00:42:34,540 --> 00:42:36,540
I like it.

1219
00:42:36,540 --> 00:42:38,540
I did it on purpose.

1220
00:42:38,540 --> 00:42:40,540
You got perfect.

1221
00:42:40,540 --> 00:42:42,540
I don't like sweet scents.

1222
00:42:42,540 --> 00:42:44,540
I like sweet scents.

1223
00:42:44,540 --> 00:42:46,540
Sometimes, someday.

1224
00:42:46,540 --> 00:42:48,540
But it's weird.

1225
00:42:48,540 --> 00:42:50,540
I think Santa likes sweet things.

1226
00:42:50,540 --> 00:42:52,540
He likes cookies.

1227
00:42:52,540 --> 00:42:54,540
And this.

1228
00:42:54,540 --> 00:42:56,540
I'm so excited.

1229
00:42:56,540 --> 00:42:58,540
What is it?

1230
00:42:58,540 --> 00:43:00,540
This is a highlight.

1231
00:43:00,540 --> 00:43:02,540
I'll show you.

1232
00:43:02,540 --> 00:43:04,540
This is cute.

1233
00:43:04,540 --> 00:43:06,540
This is cute.

1234
00:43:06,540 --> 00:43:08,540
But it was too hard to wrap.

1235
00:43:08,540 --> 00:43:10,540
So I just did it like this.

1236
00:43:10,540 --> 00:43:12,540
It's cool.

1237
00:43:12,540 --> 00:43:14,540
It looks like a figure.

1238
00:43:14,540 --> 00:43:16,540
It's a teddy bear.

1239
00:43:16,540 --> 00:43:18,540
I can feel the legs.

1240
00:43:18,540 --> 00:43:20,540
Oh my god.

1241
00:43:20,540 --> 00:43:22,540
So cute.

1242
00:43:26,540 --> 00:43:28,540
What is this?

1243
00:43:30,540 --> 00:43:32,540
Like this?

1244
00:43:32,540 --> 00:43:34,540
So cute.

1245
00:43:34,540 --> 00:43:36,540
Oh my god.

1246
00:43:36,540 --> 00:43:38,540
I saw this and it looked like you.

1247
00:43:38,540 --> 00:43:40,540
And you put some accessories on it.

1248
00:43:40,540 --> 00:43:42,540
And you put some accessories on it.

1249
00:43:42,540 --> 00:43:44,540
And you put some accessories on it.

1250
00:43:44,540 --> 00:43:46,540
So cute.

1251
00:43:46,540 --> 00:43:48,540
I thought it would be cute.

1252
00:43:48,540 --> 00:43:50,540
Oh my god.

1253
00:43:50,540 --> 00:43:52,540
You're so cute.

1254
00:43:52,540 --> 00:43:54,540
I didn't even get a gift from someone.

1255
00:43:54,540 --> 00:43:56,540
I'll put it down safely.

1256
00:43:56,540 --> 00:43:58,540
I'll put it down safely.

1257
00:43:58,540 --> 00:44:00,540
No.

1258
00:44:00,540 --> 00:44:02,540
I'll take this off.

1259
00:44:02,540 --> 00:44:04,540
I also have a letter.

1260
00:44:04,540 --> 00:44:06,540
Look forward to it.

1261
00:44:06,540 --> 00:44:08,540
Shoulder?

1262
00:44:08,540 --> 00:44:10,540
Shoulder?

1263
00:44:10,540 --> 00:44:12,540
Shoulder?

1264
00:44:12,540 --> 00:44:14,540
Shoulder?

1265
00:44:14,540 --> 00:44:16,540
Shoulder?

1266
00:44:16,540 --> 00:44:18,540
Shoulder?

1267
00:44:18,540 --> 00:44:20,540
Shoulder?

1268
00:44:20,540 --> 00:44:22,540
Shoulder?

1269
00:44:22,540 --> 00:44:24,540
Shoulder?

1270
00:44:24,540 --> 00:44:26,540
Shoulder?

1271
00:44:26,540 --> 00:44:28,540
Shoulder?

1272
00:44:28,540 --> 00:44:30,540
Oh my god.

1273
00:44:30,540 --> 00:44:32,540
Twinsies.

1274
00:44:32,540 --> 00:44:34,540
I heard we can put this up.

1275
00:44:34,540 --> 00:44:36,540
Really?

1276
00:44:36,540 --> 00:44:38,540
We should put two up.

1277
00:44:38,540 --> 00:44:40,540
They got a friend.

1278
00:44:40,540 --> 00:44:42,540
One is Manzoo and one is Daniel.

1279
00:44:42,540 --> 00:44:44,540
Because I'm bad at it.

1280
00:44:44,540 --> 00:44:46,540
Finally.

1281
00:44:46,540 --> 00:44:48,540
I feel a little hot here.

1282
00:44:48,540 --> 00:44:50,540
Is it hot in here?

1283
00:44:50,540 --> 00:44:52,540
We're in onesies.

1284
00:44:52,540 --> 00:44:54,540
We got another layer of skin.

1285
00:44:54,540 --> 00:44:56,540
I don't know.

1286
00:44:56,540 --> 00:44:58,540
I don't know.

1287
00:44:58,540 --> 00:45:00,540
Why are my hands like this?

1288
00:45:00,540 --> 00:45:02,540
Why are my hands like this?

1289
00:45:02,540 --> 00:45:04,540
Mystery.

1290
00:45:04,540 --> 00:45:06,540
I can't read the instructions.

1291
00:45:06,540 --> 00:45:08,540
You're curious, right?

1292
00:45:08,540 --> 00:45:10,540
Please check box.

1293
00:45:10,540 --> 00:45:12,540
Mystery.

1294
00:45:12,540 --> 00:45:14,540
I can open it.

1295
00:45:14,540 --> 00:45:16,540
We need a knife.

1296
00:45:16,540 --> 00:45:18,540
No, that's not it.

1297
00:45:18,540 --> 00:45:20,540
Then, wait.

1298
00:45:20,540 --> 00:45:22,540
No, it's fine.

1299
00:45:22,540 --> 00:45:24,540
We can do it.

1300
00:45:24,540 --> 00:45:26,540
We can do it.

1301
00:45:26,540 --> 00:45:28,540
This is not bad.

1302
00:45:28,540 --> 00:45:30,540
Charisma.

1303
00:45:30,540 --> 00:45:32,540
Charisma.

1304
00:45:32,540 --> 00:45:34,540
Charisma.

1305
00:45:34,540 --> 00:45:36,540
Oh my god.

1306
00:45:36,540 --> 00:45:38,540
Oh my god.

1307
00:45:38,540 --> 00:45:40,540
Oh my god.

1308
00:45:40,540 --> 00:45:42,540
Stop it.

1309
00:45:42,540 --> 00:45:44,540
You glow girl.

1310
00:45:44,540 --> 00:45:46,540
You glow girl.

1311
00:45:46,540 --> 00:45:48,540
This is crazy.

1312
00:45:48,540 --> 00:45:50,540
Oh my god.

1313
00:45:50,540 --> 00:45:52,540
So cute.

1314
00:45:52,540 --> 00:45:54,540
This is really.

1315
00:45:54,540 --> 00:45:56,540
You use both of them.

1316
00:45:56,540 --> 00:45:58,540
If you open this.

1317
00:45:58,540 --> 00:46:00,540
Hot pink and white.

1318
00:46:00,540 --> 00:46:02,540
Oh my god.

1319
00:46:02,540 --> 00:46:04,540
You glow girl.

1320
00:46:04,540 --> 00:46:06,540
You glow girl.

1321
00:46:06,540 --> 00:46:08,540
Did you choose the color?

1322
00:46:08,540 --> 00:46:10,540
If you put it on your eyes.

1323
00:46:10,540 --> 00:46:12,540
Makeup.

1324
00:46:12,540 --> 00:46:14,540
You glow girl.

1325
00:46:14,540 --> 00:46:16,540
You glow girl.

1326
00:46:16,540 --> 00:46:18,540
You glow girl.

1327
00:46:18,540 --> 00:46:20,540
Got it.

1328
00:46:20,540 --> 00:46:22,540
Aww.

1329
00:46:22,540 --> 00:46:24,540
I'm glad you like it.

1330
00:46:24,540 --> 00:46:26,540
I'm going to decorate it today.

1331
00:46:26,540 --> 00:46:28,540
Okay.

1332
00:46:28,540 --> 00:46:30,540
Next person.

1333
00:46:30,540 --> 00:46:32,540
Next person.

1334
00:46:32,540 --> 00:46:34,540
I'll do it.

1335
00:46:34,540 --> 00:46:36,540
Babam.

1336
00:46:38,540 --> 00:46:40,540
I think this is amazing.

1337
00:46:40,540 --> 00:46:42,540
This is a set.

1338
00:46:42,540 --> 00:46:44,540
Wow, this is really good.

1339
00:46:44,540 --> 00:46:46,540
You can do it in the order you want.

1340
00:46:46,540 --> 00:46:48,540
But I drew it a little bit.

1341
00:46:48,540 --> 00:46:50,540
Then.

1342
00:46:50,540 --> 00:46:52,540
Then.

1343
00:46:52,540 --> 00:46:54,540
I'll do this first.

1344
00:46:54,540 --> 00:46:56,540
How do I open this?

1345
00:46:56,540 --> 00:46:58,540
Yeah.

1346
00:46:58,540 --> 00:47:00,540
How do I open this?

1347
00:47:00,540 --> 00:47:02,540
How do I open this?

1348
00:47:02,540 --> 00:47:04,540
But it's pretty.

1349
00:47:04,540 --> 00:47:06,540
I'm looking forward to it.

1350
00:47:06,540 --> 00:47:08,540
I'm looking forward to it.

1351
00:47:08,540 --> 00:47:10,540
You drew it so well.

1352
00:47:10,540 --> 00:47:12,540
What is it?

1353
00:47:12,540 --> 00:47:14,540
This is a postcard.

1354
00:47:14,540 --> 00:47:16,540
Oh my god.

1355
00:47:16,540 --> 00:47:18,540
It's not special.

1356
00:47:18,540 --> 00:47:20,540
So cute.

1357
00:47:20,540 --> 00:47:22,540
We've been traveling a lot.

1358
00:47:22,540 --> 00:47:24,540
We've been traveling a lot.

1359
00:47:24,540 --> 00:47:26,540
I suddenly remembered changing the concert in my head.

1360
00:47:26,540 --> 00:47:28,540
I suddenly remembered changing the concert in my head.

1361
00:47:28,540 --> 00:47:30,540
I didn't know I'd lose that.

1362
00:47:30,540 --> 00:47:32,540
I didn't know I'd lose that.

1363
00:47:32,540 --> 00:47:34,540
What is it?

1364
00:47:34,540 --> 00:47:36,540
Oh my god.

1365
00:47:36,540 --> 00:47:38,540
It's a couch.

1366
00:47:38,540 --> 00:47:40,540
Is it a couch?

1367
00:47:40,540 --> 00:47:42,540
It's so cute.

1368
00:47:42,540 --> 00:47:44,540
It's like a plastic bag.

1369
00:47:44,540 --> 00:47:46,540
It's like a macaron color.

1370
00:47:46,540 --> 00:47:48,540
It's like a macaron color.

1371
00:47:48,540 --> 00:47:50,540
It's so cute.

1372
00:47:50,540 --> 00:47:52,540
It's so cute.

1373
00:47:52,540 --> 00:47:54,540
It'll look good on your room.

1374
00:47:54,540 --> 00:47:56,540
It's so pretty.

1375
00:47:56,540 --> 00:47:58,540
I bought this at Hojiga Set.

1376
00:47:58,540 --> 00:48:00,540
I didn't know you had so many things to do.

1377
00:48:00,540 --> 00:48:02,540
I should carry this around.

1378
00:48:02,540 --> 00:48:04,540
I should carry this around.

1379
00:48:04,540 --> 00:48:06,540
I put it in the plastic bag in front of me.

1380
00:48:06,540 --> 00:48:08,540
Thank you.

1381
00:48:08,540 --> 00:48:10,540
You should buy this, too.

1382
00:48:10,540 --> 00:48:12,540
Next.

1383
00:48:12,540 --> 00:48:14,540
Next.

1384
00:48:14,540 --> 00:48:16,540
I think my face is really red.

1385
00:48:16,540 --> 00:48:18,540
I think my face is really red.

1386
00:48:18,540 --> 00:48:20,540
Really?

1387
00:48:20,540 --> 00:48:22,540
This is my first time wearing this.

1388
00:48:22,540 --> 00:48:24,540
This is my first time wearing this.

1389
00:48:24,540 --> 00:48:26,540
It's very hairy.

1390
00:48:26,540 --> 00:48:28,540
It's very hairy.

1391
00:48:28,540 --> 00:48:30,540
It's very hairy.

1392
00:48:30,540 --> 00:48:32,540
I'll wear it like this.

1393
00:48:32,540 --> 00:48:34,540
Oh, my God.

1394
00:48:34,540 --> 00:48:36,540
I think this is so cute.

1395
00:48:36,540 --> 00:48:38,540
It's so cute.

1396
00:48:38,540 --> 00:48:40,540
I like it.

1397
00:48:40,540 --> 00:48:42,540
It's cute.

1398
00:48:42,540 --> 00:48:44,540
I like it.

1399
00:48:44,540 --> 00:48:46,540
I like it.

1400
00:48:46,540 --> 00:48:48,540
I like it.

1401
00:48:48,540 --> 00:48:50,540
I like it.

1402
00:48:50,540 --> 00:48:52,540
I like it.

1403
00:48:52,540 --> 00:48:54,540
I like it.

1404
00:48:54,540 --> 00:48:56,540
I like it.

1405
00:48:56,540 --> 00:49:00,540
This man wrapped it so cute.

1406
00:49:00,540 --> 00:49:02,040
This is so cute.

1407
00:49:02,040 --> 00:49:03,040
This is so pretty.

1408
00:49:03,040 --> 00:49:04,040
Really.

1409
00:49:04,040 --> 00:49:05,540
It's a rabbit.

1410
00:49:06,040 --> 00:49:08,040
Go up there.

1411
00:49:13,040 --> 00:49:15,040
So cute.

1412
00:49:15,040 --> 00:49:17,040
Is that a handmade?

1413
00:49:17,040 --> 00:49:18,040
Yes, it's a handmade.

1414
00:49:18,040 --> 00:49:20,540
The one in the closet is the most popular.

1415
00:49:20,540 --> 00:49:22,040
This is a rabbit.

1416
00:49:22,040 --> 00:49:24,040
It looks like a real rabbit.

1417
00:49:26,540 --> 00:49:28,540
So cute.

1418
00:49:28,540 --> 00:49:30,540
It looks like Hyerin.

1419
00:49:30,540 --> 00:49:32,540
I'll put it in my room.

1420
00:49:32,540 --> 00:49:34,540
So cute.

1421
00:49:37,540 --> 00:49:39,540
You'll be surprised when you read it.

1422
00:49:39,540 --> 00:49:41,540
I'll put this one first.

1423
00:49:48,540 --> 00:49:51,540
This pink box is...

1424
00:49:53,540 --> 00:49:55,540
What is it?

1425
00:49:56,540 --> 00:49:58,540
What is it?

1426
00:49:58,540 --> 00:50:00,540
What is it?

1427
00:50:00,540 --> 00:50:02,540
What is it?

1428
00:50:04,540 --> 00:50:06,540
Is it what I think?

1429
00:50:06,540 --> 00:50:08,540
I'm really pretty.

1430
00:50:10,540 --> 00:50:12,540
That time...

1431
00:50:12,540 --> 00:50:14,540
Where is it?

1432
00:50:14,540 --> 00:50:16,540
We went together.

1433
00:50:16,540 --> 00:50:18,540
Where is it? Tell me more.

1434
00:50:18,540 --> 00:50:20,540
What is it?

1435
00:50:20,540 --> 00:50:22,540
I'll take it to the room.

1436
00:50:22,540 --> 00:50:24,540
This is...

1437
00:50:24,540 --> 00:50:25,540
It's a pencil case.

1438
00:50:25,540 --> 00:50:26,540
It's a pencil case.

1439
00:50:26,540 --> 00:50:27,540
It's a pencil case.

1440
00:50:27,540 --> 00:50:28,540
It's so pretty.

1441
00:50:28,540 --> 00:50:31,540
Me and Hani went to Japan for a day and a half.

1442
00:50:31,540 --> 00:50:33,540
We went around together.

1443
00:50:33,540 --> 00:50:35,540
I went to this store.

1444
00:50:35,540 --> 00:50:37,540
I bought it then.

1445
00:50:37,540 --> 00:50:39,540
I'm so happy.

1446
00:50:39,540 --> 00:50:41,540
I thought it was so pretty.

1447
00:50:41,540 --> 00:50:43,540
This color.

1448
00:50:43,540 --> 00:50:45,540
But I saw something else.

1449
00:50:45,540 --> 00:50:47,540
Then I'll buy it.

1450
00:50:47,540 --> 00:50:49,540
I'm so happy.

1451
00:50:49,540 --> 00:50:52,540
There are so many things to use in this pouch.

1452
00:50:52,540 --> 00:50:53,540
That's right.

1453
00:50:53,540 --> 00:50:55,540
There's a small pocket in here.

1454
00:50:55,540 --> 00:50:56,540
There's a small pocket in here.

1455
00:50:56,540 --> 00:50:57,540
What?

1456
00:50:57,540 --> 00:50:58,540
What?

1457
00:50:58,540 --> 00:50:59,540
This is so nice.

1458
00:50:59,540 --> 00:51:00,540
I'm taking it here.

1459
00:51:00,540 --> 00:51:01,540
I want to go too.

1460
00:51:01,540 --> 00:51:02,540
I got it. I got it.

1461
00:51:02,540 --> 00:51:03,540
I'm going to use this well.

1462
00:51:03,540 --> 00:51:04,540
This is so pretty.

1463
00:51:04,540 --> 00:51:05,540
It looks like Kang Yerin.

1464
00:51:05,540 --> 00:51:06,540
It looks like Hyelin.

1465
00:51:06,540 --> 00:51:08,540
Kang Yerin.

1466
00:51:08,540 --> 00:51:11,540
Put all the gifts in here and put it in a pouch.

1467
00:51:11,540 --> 00:51:13,540
Put it here.

1468
00:51:13,540 --> 00:51:14,540
Now?

1469
00:51:14,540 --> 00:51:16,540
It's so cute.

1470
00:51:18,540 --> 00:51:20,540
So pretty.

1471
00:51:20,540 --> 00:51:21,540
This is a set.

1472
00:51:21,540 --> 00:51:22,540
This is a set.

1473
00:51:22,540 --> 00:51:23,540
I'll open it.

1474
00:51:23,540 --> 00:51:24,540
I wonder what kind of set it is.

1475
00:51:24,540 --> 00:51:25,540
This is a set.

1476
00:51:25,540 --> 00:51:26,540
This is a set.

1477
00:51:26,540 --> 00:51:28,540
I love this.

1478
00:51:28,540 --> 00:51:29,540
I think I know what it is.

1479
00:51:29,540 --> 00:51:30,540
I don't know what it is.

1480
00:51:30,540 --> 00:51:31,540
I don't know what it is.

1481
00:51:31,540 --> 00:51:32,540
No?

1482
00:51:32,540 --> 00:51:33,540
No.

1483
00:51:33,540 --> 00:51:35,540
Oh my god.

1484
00:51:35,540 --> 00:51:37,540
But recently, we've been...

1485
00:51:37,540 --> 00:51:38,540
That's right.

1486
00:51:38,540 --> 00:51:40,540
That's why I asked you.

1487
00:51:40,540 --> 00:51:41,540
So I was looking at it.

1488
00:51:41,540 --> 00:51:42,540
That's right.

1489
00:51:42,540 --> 00:51:43,540
It's the same one.

1490
00:51:43,540 --> 00:51:44,540
But I don't think it's the same.

1491
00:51:44,540 --> 00:51:45,540
It's different.

1492
00:51:45,540 --> 00:51:46,540
It's really funny if something else comes out.

1493
00:51:46,540 --> 00:51:47,540
Then this one, too.

1494
00:51:47,540 --> 00:51:49,540
This one is a little different.

1495
00:51:49,540 --> 00:51:50,540
This one is really good.

1496
00:51:50,540 --> 00:51:51,540
You had this when you bought it, right?

1497
00:51:51,540 --> 00:51:52,540
Yes.

1498
00:51:54,540 --> 00:51:55,540
It's so cute.

1499
00:51:55,540 --> 00:51:56,540
It's a baby kitten.

1500
00:51:56,540 --> 00:51:57,540
Baby kitten.

1501
00:51:57,540 --> 00:51:58,540
Baby kitten.

1502
00:51:58,540 --> 00:51:59,540
Wow, it's so cute.

1503
00:51:59,540 --> 00:52:00,540
This and...

1504
00:52:00,540 --> 00:52:01,540
Here.

1505
00:52:01,540 --> 00:52:02,540
Thank you.

1506
00:52:02,540 --> 00:52:03,540
Oh, it's piled up.

1507
00:52:03,540 --> 00:52:04,540
She's getting faster.

1508
00:52:04,540 --> 00:52:05,540
I think there's no room for them.

1509
00:52:05,540 --> 00:52:06,540
Oh, these guys.

1510
00:52:06,540 --> 00:52:07,540
The babies can't be put on the floor.

1511
00:52:07,540 --> 00:52:08,540
Oh my gosh.

1512
00:52:08,540 --> 00:52:09,540
Oh my gosh.

1513
00:52:09,540 --> 00:52:10,540
I think I'll have to buy the one that I want to buy.

1514
00:52:10,540 --> 00:52:11,540
You can't hold it.

1515
00:52:11,540 --> 00:52:12,540
I think I'll have to buy the one I want to buy.

1516
00:52:12,540 --> 00:52:13,540
Oh, my gosh.

1517
00:52:13,540 --> 00:52:14,540
I'll buy it.

1518
00:52:14,540 --> 00:52:15,540
Oh my gosh.

1519
00:52:15,540 --> 00:52:16,540
I'll buy it.

1520
00:52:16,540 --> 00:52:17,540
I think this one is good.

1521
00:52:17,540 --> 00:52:18,540
Oh, my gosh.

1522
00:52:18,540 --> 00:52:19,540
Oh, my gosh.

1523
00:52:19,540 --> 00:52:20,540
I think I'll have to buy the one that I want to buy.

1524
00:52:20,540 --> 00:52:21,540
Oh, my gosh.

1525
00:52:24,540 --> 00:52:28,540
I really like cats and they were so cute.

1526
00:52:28,540 --> 00:52:31,540
But this... What is it? I've never seen a rabbit.

1527
00:52:31,540 --> 00:52:33,540
Oh my god.

1528
00:52:33,540 --> 00:52:35,540
Sylvania Family!

1529
00:52:35,540 --> 00:52:38,540
Because I'm into Sylvania.

1530
00:52:38,540 --> 00:52:41,540
I'm curious about this one.

1531
00:52:41,540 --> 00:52:44,540
It's not changing.

1532
00:52:44,540 --> 00:52:46,540
What is it?

1533
00:52:46,540 --> 00:52:48,540
Oh, that cute one.

1534
00:52:48,540 --> 00:52:50,540
A silver drop.

1535
00:52:50,540 --> 00:52:52,540
It's the only story that hasn't been left.

1536
00:52:52,540 --> 00:52:54,540
A silver drop.

1537
00:52:54,540 --> 00:52:57,540
I thought it was a rabbit.

1538
00:52:57,540 --> 00:52:58,540
Oh!

1539
00:52:58,540 --> 00:53:00,540
Sorry, a silver drop.

1540
00:53:00,540 --> 00:53:06,540
I'll hide it in their room.

1541
00:53:06,540 --> 00:53:10,540
I'll leave it here.

1542
00:53:10,540 --> 00:53:12,540
Let's go find it.

1543
00:53:12,540 --> 00:53:14,540
Finally.

1544
00:53:14,540 --> 00:53:16,540
A tomato.

1545
00:53:16,540 --> 00:53:18,540
This is just...

1546
00:53:18,540 --> 00:53:20,540
I've given too many cute ones.

1547
00:53:20,540 --> 00:53:22,540
To match the balance.

1548
00:53:22,540 --> 00:53:24,540
Where did you buy it?

1549
00:53:24,540 --> 00:53:26,540
It's not a super cute one.

1550
00:53:26,540 --> 00:53:28,540
I'll take a look.

1551
00:53:28,540 --> 00:53:30,540
I'll take a look.

1552
00:53:30,540 --> 00:53:32,540
Come in.

1553
00:53:32,540 --> 00:53:34,540
Come in.

1554
00:53:34,540 --> 00:53:36,540
Oh, is it a clothes?

1555
00:53:36,540 --> 00:53:38,540
Oh my god.

1556
00:53:38,540 --> 00:53:41,540
Oh, it looks like a single.

1557
00:53:41,540 --> 00:53:42,540
Single.

1558
00:53:42,540 --> 00:53:44,540
Oh, sister.

1559
00:53:44,540 --> 00:53:46,540
Oh, sister.

1560
00:53:46,540 --> 00:53:49,540
Oh, this is a limited edition.

1561
00:53:49,540 --> 00:53:51,540
Oh, when you go.

1562
00:53:52,540 --> 00:53:53,540
Is it a shirt?

1563
00:53:53,540 --> 00:53:54,540
But, but, everyone.

1564
00:53:54,540 --> 00:53:55,540
The back is really pretty, too.

1565
00:53:55,540 --> 00:53:57,540
This is the pop-up.

1566
00:53:57,540 --> 00:53:59,540
You're going to pop up all over the world.

1567
00:53:59,540 --> 00:54:00,540
Pop-up.

1568
00:54:00,540 --> 00:54:02,540
It's a mini-gallon to pop up.

1569
00:54:02,540 --> 00:54:03,540
Pop-up?

1570
00:54:03,540 --> 00:54:05,540
Oh, it's so cute.

1571
00:54:05,540 --> 00:54:07,540
Oh, cute.

1572
00:54:07,540 --> 00:54:08,540
It's snowman.

1573
00:54:08,540 --> 00:54:09,540
I don't know if the size fits well.

1574
00:54:09,540 --> 00:54:10,540
No, it's okay.

1575
00:54:10,540 --> 00:54:12,540
You know our size, right?

1576
00:54:12,540 --> 00:54:13,540
Thank you.

1577
00:54:13,540 --> 00:54:14,540
This is a sticker.

1578
00:54:14,540 --> 00:54:16,540
I needed something to wear inside.

1579
00:54:16,540 --> 00:54:18,540
That's right.

1580
00:54:18,540 --> 00:54:19,540
Wow.

1581
00:54:19,540 --> 00:54:20,540
It's a style.

1582
00:54:20,540 --> 00:54:21,540
Oh, my god.

1583
00:54:21,540 --> 00:54:22,540
Isn't it cute?

1584
00:54:22,540 --> 00:54:23,540
It's so cute.

1585
00:54:23,540 --> 00:54:24,540
Oh, my heart.

1586
00:54:24,540 --> 00:54:25,540
It's so cute because she's wearing it.

1587
00:54:25,540 --> 00:54:27,540
I'm going from spring to the end of the year.ierto

1588
00:54:27,540 --> 00:54:28,540
It's for our anniversary.

1589
00:54:28,540 --> 00:54:29,540
It's 한 사림 4.

1590
00:54:29,540 --> 00:54:30,540
Oh.

1591
00:54:30,540 --> 00:54:31,540
Thank you so much.

1592
00:54:31,540 --> 00:54:32,540
Oh.

1593
00:54:32,540 --> 00:54:33,540
Thank you so much.

1594
00:54:34,540 --> 00:54:35,540
Thank you so much.

1595
00:54:36,540 --> 00:54:37,540
Jaramdar.

1596
00:54:37,540 --> 00:54:43,540
Jajaranda

1597
00:54:43,540 --> 00:54:44,540
fique.

1598
00:54:44,540 --> 00:54:45,540
You know draw the hook quickly?

1599
00:54:45,540 --> 00:54:47,540
Because I didn't want to show this stamp in the end.

1600
00:54:47,540 --> 00:54:48,540
Oh, yes.

1601
00:54:48,540 --> 00:54:49,540
Use it like this.

1602
00:54:49,540 --> 00:54:50,540
okay?

1603
00:54:50,540 --> 00:54:51,540
It's okay.

1604
00:54:51,540 --> 00:54:53,540
Hey you brown broodle

1605
00:54:53,540 --> 00:54:55,540
Oh sorry

1606
00:54:55,540 --> 00:54:57,540
It hurts so much

1607
00:54:57,540 --> 00:54:59,540
The gift box given to her

1608
00:54:59,540 --> 00:55:01,540
I'm sorry I couldn't bring it

1609
00:55:01,540 --> 00:55:03,540
Explain

1610
00:55:03,540 --> 00:55:07,540
I have this and one more

1611
00:55:07,540 --> 00:55:09,540
That's the main

1612
00:55:09,540 --> 00:55:11,540
I couldn't bring the main

1613
00:55:11,540 --> 00:55:13,540
So this is a little

1614
00:55:13,540 --> 00:55:17,540
It's a little light

1615
00:55:17,540 --> 00:55:21,540
How cool is the main?

1616
00:55:21,540 --> 00:55:23,540
I'll look forward to it

1617
00:55:23,540 --> 00:55:25,540
I'll unbox it

1618
00:55:25,540 --> 00:55:27,540
It's so pretty

1619
00:55:27,540 --> 00:55:29,540
I'll use this box too

1620
00:55:29,540 --> 00:55:31,540
Oh my god

1621
00:55:31,540 --> 00:55:33,540
I have to show you the inside

1622
00:55:35,540 --> 00:55:37,540
Oh my god

1623
00:55:37,540 --> 00:55:39,540
Where do you find it?

1624
00:55:41,540 --> 00:55:43,540
I don't know if you can see it

1625
00:55:43,540 --> 00:55:45,540
Here

1626
00:55:45,540 --> 00:55:47,540
In Hyein's room

1627
00:55:47,540 --> 00:55:49,540
I think it would be nice to have this kind of feeling

1628
00:55:49,540 --> 00:55:51,540
I think I'll put it on the cabinet

1629
00:55:51,540 --> 00:55:53,540
I can't think of that

1630
00:55:53,540 --> 00:55:55,540
The wooden cabinet

1631
00:55:57,540 --> 00:55:59,540
Oh my god

1632
00:55:59,540 --> 00:56:01,540
Hyein's legs are long

1633
00:56:03,540 --> 00:56:05,540
Touch the shoes

1634
00:56:07,540 --> 00:56:09,540
So cute

1635
00:56:09,540 --> 00:56:11,540
I can't find it easily

1636
00:56:11,540 --> 00:56:13,540
I can't find it easily

1637
00:56:13,540 --> 00:56:15,540
I'll put it next to this

1638
00:56:15,540 --> 00:56:17,540
Oh my god

1639
00:56:17,540 --> 00:56:19,540
It's so pretty

1640
00:56:19,540 --> 00:56:21,540
It's so pretty

1641
00:56:21,540 --> 00:56:23,540
It's pretty

1642
00:56:23,540 --> 00:56:25,540
Then

1643
00:56:25,540 --> 00:56:27,540
Thank you Santa

1644
00:56:27,540 --> 00:56:29,540
It'll look good on you

1645
00:56:29,540 --> 00:56:31,540
Oh my god

1646
00:56:31,540 --> 00:56:33,540
Oh my god

1647
00:56:33,540 --> 00:56:35,540
So cute

1648
00:56:35,540 --> 00:56:37,540
So cute

1649
00:56:37,540 --> 00:56:39,540
I just gave it to you

1650
00:56:39,540 --> 00:56:41,540
I just gave it to you

1651
00:56:41,540 --> 00:56:43,540
I just gave it to you

1652
00:56:43,540 --> 00:56:45,540
I just gave it to you

1653
00:56:45,540 --> 00:56:47,540
Hidden socks

1654
00:56:47,540 --> 00:56:49,540
I'm putting on my sleeping socks

1655
00:56:49,540 --> 00:56:51,540
It's like a rainbow

1656
00:56:51,540 --> 00:56:53,540
Now it's three

1657
00:56:53,540 --> 00:56:55,540
This is so cute too

1658
00:56:55,540 --> 00:56:57,540
I did this a lot when I was a trainee

1659
00:56:57,540 --> 00:56:59,540
Cute socks like new jeans

1660
00:56:59,540 --> 00:57:01,540
Thank you

1661
00:57:01,540 --> 00:57:03,540
It's cute

1662
00:57:03,540 --> 00:57:05,540
Cute

1663
00:57:05,540 --> 00:57:07,540
Wait who's left

1664
00:57:07,540 --> 00:57:09,540
We love so much we became like

1665
00:57:09,540 --> 00:57:11,540
Me me

1666
00:57:11,540 --> 00:57:13,540
Me me

1667
00:57:13,540 --> 00:57:15,540
Let's go

1668
00:57:15,540 --> 00:57:17,540
Oh oh oh

1669
00:57:17,540 --> 00:57:19,540
Merry Christmas

1670
00:57:19,540 --> 00:57:21,540
Merry Christmas

1671
00:57:21,540 --> 00:57:23,540
Merry Christmas

1672
00:57:23,540 --> 00:57:25,540
I'll hit it too

1673
00:57:25,540 --> 00:57:27,540
I couldn't wrap it up like this

1674
00:57:27,540 --> 00:57:29,540
So I'd appreciate it if you could close your eyes and open it

1675
00:57:29,540 --> 00:57:31,540
So I'd appreciate it if you could close your eyes and open it

1676
00:57:31,540 --> 00:57:33,540
This is too

1677
00:57:33,540 --> 00:57:35,540
Too obvious

1678
00:57:35,540 --> 00:57:37,540
So I'll just run like this

1679
00:57:37,540 --> 00:57:39,540
So I'll just run like this

1680
00:57:39,540 --> 00:57:41,540
Actually it's here too

1681
00:57:41,540 --> 00:57:43,540
But I think this will be okay

1682
00:57:43,540 --> 00:57:45,540
Just put it on top

1683
00:57:45,540 --> 00:57:47,540
But this is

1684
00:57:47,540 --> 00:57:49,540
Just put it on top

1685
00:57:49,540 --> 00:57:51,540
Just put it on top

1686
00:57:51,540 --> 00:57:53,540
Oh god

1687
00:57:53,540 --> 00:57:55,540
What's with your hat man

1688
00:57:55,540 --> 00:57:57,540
You need to close your eyes

1689
00:57:57,540 --> 00:57:59,540
Okay okay

1690
00:57:59,540 --> 00:58:01,540
I want to eat it

1691
00:58:01,540 --> 00:58:03,540
I want to eat it

1692
00:58:03,540 --> 00:58:05,540
Drumroll

1693
00:58:05,540 --> 00:58:07,540
Drumroll

1694
00:58:07,540 --> 00:58:09,540
That's little spring tea

1695
00:58:09,540 --> 00:58:11,540
That's little spring tea

1696
00:58:11,540 --> 00:58:13,540
Oh my god

1697
00:58:13,540 --> 00:58:15,540
It's too heavy

1698
00:58:15,540 --> 00:58:17,540
It's tooSince

1699
00:58:17,540 --> 00:58:19,540
Oh but it's right

1700
00:58:19,540 --> 00:58:21,540
It's white today

1701
00:58:21,540 --> 00:58:23,540
So cute

1702
00:58:23,540 --> 00:58:25,540
Oh my so cute

1703
00:58:25,540 --> 00:58:27,540
It looks like you

1704
00:58:27,540 --> 00:58:29,540
I thought of it

1705
00:58:29,540 --> 00:58:31,540
I thought of it

1706
00:58:31,540 --> 00:58:33,540
Keep going

1707
00:58:33,540 --> 00:58:35,540
Keep going

1708
00:58:35,540 --> 00:58:37,540
Oh my god

1709
00:58:37,540 --> 00:58:39,540
Why why why

1710
00:58:39,540 --> 00:58:41,540
Can I show it

1711
00:58:41,540 --> 00:58:43,540
Can I show it

1712
00:58:43,540 --> 00:58:45,540
Just a trembling eyes

1713
00:58:45,540 --> 00:58:47,540
I'm trembling

1714
00:58:47,540 --> 00:58:59,360
My brows are

1715
00:58:59,560 --> 00:59:01,560
Oh showers

1716
00:59:01,560 --> 00:59:03,540
Oh my god

1717
00:59:03,540 --> 00:59:05,540
Gabriel

1718
00:59:05,540 --> 00:59:07,540
Hero

1719
00:59:07,540 --> 00:59:09,540
That's right

1720
00:59:09,540 --> 00:59:11,540
That's right

1721
00:59:11,540 --> 00:59:13,540
I'm some ruffian

1722
00:59:13,540 --> 00:59:15,300
I thought about this for a long time

1723
00:59:15,300 --> 00:59:17,380
Shall I take the scissors?

1724
00:59:17,380 --> 00:59:18,380
Powerful.

1725
00:59:18,380 --> 00:59:19,880
No, you're gonna hurt your thingy.

1726
00:59:19,880 --> 00:59:21,880
Thingy, thingy.

1727
00:59:24,380 --> 00:59:25,880
Oh my god.

1728
00:59:26,880 --> 00:59:28,380
So cute.

1729
00:59:28,380 --> 00:59:30,380
We have rabbit scissors.

1730
00:59:32,380 --> 00:59:33,880
No, no, no.

1731
00:59:36,880 --> 00:59:37,880
Oh my god.

1732
00:59:37,880 --> 00:59:38,880
It's the best, right?

1733
00:59:38,880 --> 00:59:39,880
Oh my god.

1734
00:59:39,880 --> 00:59:40,880
Do it then.

1735
00:59:44,880 --> 00:59:46,880
I really thought about it.

1736
00:59:46,880 --> 00:59:48,380
Do it. Do it.

1737
00:59:48,380 --> 00:59:49,380
Do it.

1738
00:59:49,380 --> 00:59:50,880
I had one thing.

1739
00:59:50,880 --> 00:59:52,380
A similar style.

1740
00:59:54,880 --> 00:59:55,880
It looks good on you.

1741
00:59:55,880 --> 00:59:56,880
Good job.

1742
00:59:56,880 --> 00:59:57,880
It's okay, it's okay.

1743
01:00:00,880 --> 01:00:01,880
Good job.

1744
01:00:01,880 --> 01:00:02,880
Yeah, good job, my manita.

1745
01:00:02,880 --> 01:00:04,880
But I still find the bunny the funniest.

1746
01:00:04,880 --> 01:00:05,880
No, you don't need that.

1747
01:00:05,880 --> 01:00:06,880
There's a bunny.

1748
01:00:10,380 --> 01:00:11,880
Oh my god.

1749
01:00:11,880 --> 01:00:13,380
How is it, everyone?

1750
01:00:13,380 --> 01:00:14,880
Isn't it so cute?

1751
01:00:14,880 --> 01:00:16,380
So cute.

1752
01:00:16,880 --> 01:00:19,640
And what do we have here?

1753
01:00:19,640 --> 01:00:21,380
There were so many things for the bunny.

1754
01:00:21,380 --> 01:00:22,380
There were so many things.

1755
01:00:22,380 --> 01:00:24,380
I think I need to size it up a little.

1756
01:00:24,380 --> 01:00:25,560
All right, I'll get it.

1757
01:00:25,560 --> 01:00:26,880
Is it enough?

1758
01:00:26,880 --> 01:00:27,880
So cute.

1759
01:00:27,880 --> 01:00:28,380
No, it's too obvious.

1760
01:00:28,380 --> 01:00:29,700
Excuse, I need to get it.

1761
01:00:32,880 --> 01:00:35,380
Please wait guys.

1762
01:00:35,380 --> 01:00:36,380
Let's go to the group photo room.

1763
01:00:36,380 --> 01:00:37,380
Okay?

1764
01:00:37,380 --> 01:00:38,380
I hope they won't kill me this time.

1765
01:00:38,380 --> 01:00:39,880
No no, no, you didn't e KKab verlier du Rahe.

1766
01:00:39,880 --> 01:00:41,380
KKreem, you didn't need to be named kавлив.

1767
01:00:41,380 --> 01:00:42,880
If you're thinking of your own speaks,

1768
01:00:42,880 --> 01:00:44,740
you really don't need to be an eek,

1769
01:00:44,740 --> 01:00:45,380
I'll let myself go and send you some.

1770
01:00:45,380 --> 01:00:46,380
Please be the most.

1771
01:00:46,880 --> 01:00:48,880
I put it in here.

1772
01:00:48,880 --> 01:00:52,880
And this is the last one.

1773
01:00:54,880 --> 01:00:56,880
I'll have to open it.

1774
01:00:58,880 --> 01:01:00,880
Is it really big?

1775
01:01:02,880 --> 01:01:04,880
It's so cute.

1776
01:01:10,880 --> 01:01:12,880
It's so cute.

1777
01:01:12,880 --> 01:01:14,880
It's so cute.

1778
01:01:16,880 --> 01:01:18,880
I kept saying I wanted it.

1779
01:01:18,880 --> 01:01:20,880
It's so cute.

1780
01:01:20,880 --> 01:01:22,880
I was carrying a book cover.

1781
01:01:22,880 --> 01:01:24,880
And Hani saw it and asked me where I bought it.

1782
01:01:24,880 --> 01:01:26,880
And Hani saw it and asked me where I bought it.

1783
01:01:26,880 --> 01:01:28,880
I already bought it for her birthday.

1784
01:01:28,880 --> 01:01:30,880
So I was like, what?

1785
01:01:30,880 --> 01:01:32,880
So I was like, what?

1786
01:01:32,880 --> 01:01:34,880
So I kept saying I didn't want it.

1787
01:01:34,880 --> 01:01:36,880
I was like, I just wanted it.

1788
01:01:36,880 --> 01:01:38,880
I was like, I just wanted it.

1789
01:01:38,880 --> 01:01:40,880
Thank you.

1790
01:01:40,880 --> 01:01:42,880
I'll have to buy a book cover.

1791
01:01:42,880 --> 01:01:44,880
Oh my god.

1792
01:01:44,880 --> 01:01:46,880
I'll have to buy a book cover.

1793
01:01:46,880 --> 01:01:48,880
I think you'll carry it around well.

1794
01:01:48,880 --> 01:01:50,880
What is it?

1795
01:01:50,880 --> 01:01:52,880
Don't show it to them.

1796
01:01:52,880 --> 01:01:54,880
It's not here.

1797
01:01:54,880 --> 01:01:56,880
It's so cute.

1798
01:01:56,880 --> 01:01:58,880
Oh my god. Thank you so much.

1799
01:01:58,880 --> 01:02:00,880
That's it.

1800
01:02:02,880 --> 01:02:04,880
This is my sister's.

1801
01:02:04,880 --> 01:02:06,880
Oh my god.

1802
01:02:06,880 --> 01:02:08,880
Oh wait, we're done.

1803
01:02:08,880 --> 01:02:10,880
Time goes so fast.

1804
01:02:10,880 --> 01:02:12,880
Yeah.

1805
01:02:12,880 --> 01:02:14,880
It's been an hour already.

1806
01:02:16,880 --> 01:02:18,880
I'm going.

1807
01:02:18,880 --> 01:02:20,880
If I fall, it's really a secret.

1808
01:02:20,880 --> 01:02:22,880
Do you have a candle?

1809
01:02:22,880 --> 01:02:24,880
No.

1810
01:02:24,880 --> 01:02:26,880
Let's just imagine.

1811
01:02:26,880 --> 01:02:28,880
My buddies, please edit it later.

1812
01:02:28,880 --> 01:02:30,880
I'll do my best.

1813
01:02:30,880 --> 01:02:32,880
Does it blow when you do it?

1814
01:02:32,880 --> 01:02:34,880
Okay.

1815
01:02:34,880 --> 01:02:36,880
Did you guys make a wish?

1816
01:02:36,880 --> 01:02:38,880
Like a holiday wish.

1817
01:02:38,880 --> 01:02:40,880
Yeah.

1818
01:02:40,880 --> 01:02:42,880
3, 2, 1.

1819
01:02:42,880 --> 01:02:44,880
Got it.

1820
01:02:44,880 --> 01:02:46,880
Okay.

1821
01:02:46,880 --> 01:02:48,880
Okay.

1822
01:02:48,880 --> 01:02:50,880
You wish me very hard.

1823
01:02:50,880 --> 01:02:52,880
Okay.

1824
01:02:52,880 --> 01:02:54,880
Wait.

1825
01:02:54,880 --> 01:02:56,880
Oh, my god.

1826
01:02:56,880 --> 01:02:58,880
I don't have anything in my practice room.

1827
01:02:58,880 --> 01:03:00,880
Only tape.

1828
01:03:00,880 --> 01:03:02,880
What do you do?

1829
01:03:02,880 --> 01:03:04,880
What do you think about Manito's session?

1830
01:03:04,880 --> 01:03:06,880
What do you think about Manito's session?

1831
01:03:06,880 --> 01:03:08,880
Session?

1832
01:03:08,880 --> 01:03:10,880
What?

1833
01:03:10,880 --> 01:03:12,880
Oh, my.

1834
01:03:12,880 --> 01:03:14,880
Oh, my.

1835
01:03:14,880 --> 01:03:16,880
What do you think of our section this time?

1836
01:03:16,880 --> 01:03:30,160
We did it

1837
01:03:30,160 --> 01:03:32,160
me

1838
01:03:32,160 --> 01:03:34,160
We spent a lot of time doing it.

1839
01:03:34,160 --> 01:03:36,880
What if you only have 3?

1840
01:03:36,880 --> 01:03:38,880
Stop.

1841
01:03:38,880 --> 01:03:42,880
What's the magic?

1842
01:03:42,880 --> 01:03:44,880
Yeah.

1843
01:03:44,880 --> 01:03:48,880
Other members prepared one, but they didn't get it yet.

1844
01:03:48,880 --> 01:03:52,880
Mine just arrived, but the letter is at home.

1845
01:03:52,880 --> 01:03:54,880
I'll give you the letter later.

1846
01:03:54,880 --> 01:03:56,880
And first...

1847
01:03:58,880 --> 01:04:00,880
Close... Each of you close your eyes.

1848
01:04:00,880 --> 01:04:02,880
And put your hands.

1849
01:04:02,880 --> 01:04:04,880
Close your eyes.

1850
01:04:04,880 --> 01:04:06,880
I'll be honest, you know those mouth-slippers for you?

1851
01:04:06,880 --> 01:04:08,880
That was kind of an early Christmas present.

1852
01:04:10,880 --> 01:04:12,880
Okay.

1853
01:04:14,880 --> 01:04:18,880
Now each reach out and pick one.

1854
01:04:22,880 --> 01:04:24,880
Open eyes? No, wait.

1855
01:04:24,880 --> 01:04:26,880
It's already opened.

1856
01:04:26,880 --> 01:04:28,880
Open!

1857
01:04:28,880 --> 01:04:30,880
Oh my god!

1858
01:04:30,880 --> 01:04:32,880
You picked the purple one.

1859
01:04:32,880 --> 01:04:34,880
I know!

1860
01:04:34,880 --> 01:04:36,880
That's crazy.

1861
01:04:36,880 --> 01:04:38,880
How did you pick that?

1862
01:04:40,880 --> 01:04:42,880
I picked the purple one.

1863
01:04:42,880 --> 01:04:44,880
Oh my god, you guys picked one.

1864
01:04:44,880 --> 01:04:46,880
I picked what I wanted you to pick.

1865
01:04:46,880 --> 01:04:48,880
That's amazing.

1866
01:04:48,880 --> 01:04:50,880
I think I'm really lucky this time.

1867
01:04:50,880 --> 01:04:52,880
I'm so lucky.

1868
01:04:52,880 --> 01:04:54,880
I'm so lucky that I didn't pick you.

1869
01:05:00,880 --> 01:05:02,880
This...

1870
01:05:02,880 --> 01:05:04,880
When you drink hot cocoa or coffee,

1871
01:05:04,880 --> 01:05:06,880
when you drink tea,

1872
01:05:08,880 --> 01:05:10,880
if you turn around and drink it,

1873
01:05:10,880 --> 01:05:12,880
It's a back-head.

1874
01:05:12,880 --> 01:05:14,880
I won't forgive you.

1875
01:05:14,880 --> 01:05:16,880
I'm gonna call it...

1876
01:05:20,880 --> 01:05:22,880
Pink...

1877
01:05:22,880 --> 01:05:24,880
Pinky...

1878
01:05:24,880 --> 01:05:26,880
Pinky pear.

1879
01:05:26,880 --> 01:05:28,880
Pinky...

1880
01:05:28,880 --> 01:05:30,880
I'm just gonna call it pear.

1881
01:05:30,880 --> 01:05:32,880
Pinky pear.

1882
01:05:32,880 --> 01:05:34,880
Oh my god.

1883
01:05:36,880 --> 01:05:38,880
What is this?

1884
01:05:38,880 --> 01:05:40,880
We're a little clumsy today.

1885
01:05:40,880 --> 01:05:42,880
What is this?

1886
01:05:42,880 --> 01:05:44,880
It's like Christmas.

1887
01:05:44,880 --> 01:05:46,880
Okay, guys, I have not tried this,

1888
01:05:46,880 --> 01:05:48,880
but I've heard good things about it,

1889
01:05:48,880 --> 01:05:50,880
so I hope you like it.

1890
01:05:50,880 --> 01:05:52,880
I'm really nervous right now because I prepared this.

1891
01:05:52,880 --> 01:05:54,880
Then you try it first.

1892
01:05:54,880 --> 01:05:56,880
I can't.

1893
01:05:56,880 --> 01:05:58,880
Please express your taste.

1894
01:05:58,880 --> 01:06:00,880
Oh, really?

1895
01:06:00,880 --> 01:06:02,880
Eat and look forward to it.

1896
01:06:02,880 --> 01:06:04,880
Is this chocolate or tiramisu?

1897
01:06:04,880 --> 01:06:06,880
This is dark chocolate.

1898
01:06:06,880 --> 01:06:08,880
That's your favorite.

1899
01:06:08,880 --> 01:06:10,880
Okay.

1900
01:06:10,880 --> 01:06:12,880
Okay.

1901
01:06:12,880 --> 01:06:14,880
I'll try to make it look good on the front.

1902
01:06:14,880 --> 01:06:16,880
Why are you so cute?

1903
01:06:16,880 --> 01:06:18,880
Love you, guys.

1904
01:06:18,880 --> 01:06:20,880
Love you, too.

1905
01:06:20,880 --> 01:06:22,880
Look at it. Look at it crumble.

1906
01:06:24,880 --> 01:06:26,880
I can't eat chocolate.

1907
01:06:26,880 --> 01:06:28,880
You should use it here.

1908
01:06:28,880 --> 01:06:30,880
Here.

1909
01:06:32,880 --> 01:06:34,880
Are you ready?

1910
01:06:34,880 --> 01:06:36,880
Hurry up.

1911
01:06:38,880 --> 01:06:40,880
That's good.

1912
01:06:42,880 --> 01:06:44,880
Do you want to try it first?

1913
01:06:50,880 --> 01:06:52,880
You don't need to say anything.

1914
01:06:52,880 --> 01:06:54,880
Actually,

1915
01:06:54,880 --> 01:06:56,880
we were with the CEO yesterday.

1916
01:06:56,880 --> 01:06:58,880
We had a dinner party.

1917
01:06:58,880 --> 01:07:00,880
We had a dinner party.

1918
01:07:00,880 --> 01:07:02,880
We had a dinner party.

1919
01:07:02,880 --> 01:07:04,880
Oh, right.

1920
01:07:04,880 --> 01:07:06,880
It's the end of the year,

1921
01:07:06,880 --> 01:07:08,880
so we need time to talk.

1922
01:07:08,880 --> 01:07:10,880
Dani is the CEO of the party.

1923
01:07:10,880 --> 01:07:12,880
I'm going to eat it.

1924
01:07:12,880 --> 01:07:14,880
It's a birthday cake.

1925
01:07:14,880 --> 01:07:16,880
So I bought this cake

1926
01:07:16,880 --> 01:07:18,880
to celebrate the birthday of the CEO.

1927
01:07:18,880 --> 01:07:20,880
I bought this cake to celebrate the birthday of the CEO.

1928
01:07:20,880 --> 01:07:22,880
But the CEO told us

1929
01:07:22,880 --> 01:07:24,880
to eat it.

1930
01:07:24,880 --> 01:07:26,880
And he said,

1931
01:07:26,880 --> 01:07:28,880
when we do the live show tomorrow,

1932
01:07:28,880 --> 01:07:30,880
you guys should eat it.

1933
01:07:30,880 --> 01:07:32,880
Thank you.

1934
01:07:32,880 --> 01:07:34,880
Thank you.

1935
01:07:34,880 --> 01:07:36,880
There's a behind story.

1936
01:07:36,880 --> 01:07:38,880
What's this?

1937
01:07:38,880 --> 01:07:40,880
It's just like cream.

1938
01:07:40,880 --> 01:07:42,880
It's hard.

1939
01:07:42,880 --> 01:07:44,880
But my mom tried it,

1940
01:07:44,880 --> 01:07:46,880
and it's really good.

1941
01:07:48,880 --> 01:07:50,880
I recommend it.

1942
01:07:50,880 --> 01:07:52,880
I recommend it.

1943
01:07:52,880 --> 01:07:54,880
Oh, my gosh.

1944
01:07:54,880 --> 01:07:56,880
Oh, my gosh.

1945
01:07:56,880 --> 01:07:58,880
Blueberry.

1946
01:07:58,880 --> 01:08:00,880
I'm nervous.

1947
01:08:00,880 --> 01:08:02,880
I like cake.

1948
01:08:02,880 --> 01:08:04,880
I like cake.

1949
01:08:04,880 --> 01:08:06,880
I think dark chocolate cake is the best.

1950
01:08:06,880 --> 01:08:08,880
I think dark chocolate cake is the best.

1951
01:08:08,880 --> 01:08:10,880
You like it, right?

1952
01:08:10,880 --> 01:08:12,880
Right?

1953
01:08:12,880 --> 01:08:14,880
You succeeded, right?

1954
01:08:14,880 --> 01:08:16,880
Honestly.

1955
01:08:16,880 --> 01:08:18,880
Yay! I'm so proud.

1956
01:08:18,880 --> 01:08:20,880
We already done for one hour.

1957
01:08:20,880 --> 01:08:22,880
More than one hour.

1958
01:08:22,880 --> 01:08:24,880
Before we wrap up,

1959
01:08:24,880 --> 01:08:26,880
please introduce us to our Bernie.

1960
01:08:26,880 --> 01:08:28,880
Great.

1961
01:08:28,880 --> 01:08:30,880
Let's bring the camera.

1962
01:08:30,880 --> 01:08:32,880
Let's get ready for the camera.

1963
01:08:32,880 --> 01:08:34,880
Shall we say hello and wrap up with these?

1964
01:08:34,880 --> 01:08:36,880
Great.

1965
01:08:36,880 --> 01:08:38,880
Hey, guys. Today.

1966
01:08:38,880 --> 01:08:40,880
I'm going to take a selfie.

1967
01:08:40,880 --> 01:08:42,880
It's already decided.

1968
01:08:42,880 --> 01:08:44,880
Okay.

1969
01:08:44,880 --> 01:08:46,880
Okay.

1970
01:08:46,880 --> 01:08:48,880
Wait. What are we going to do?

1971
01:08:48,880 --> 01:08:50,880
Happy holidays.

1972
01:08:50,880 --> 01:08:52,880
Okay. Are you ready?

1973
01:08:52,880 --> 01:08:54,880
Three, two, one.

1974
01:08:54,880 --> 01:08:56,880
Happy holidays.

1975
01:08:58,880 --> 01:09:00,880
She's doing it herself.

1976
01:09:00,880 --> 01:09:02,880
We wish you a Merry Christmas.

1977
01:09:02,880 --> 01:09:04,880
We wish you a Merry Christmas.

1978
01:09:04,880 --> 01:09:06,880
We wish you a Merry Christmas.

1979
01:09:06,880 --> 01:09:08,880
And the tree.

1980
01:09:08,880 --> 01:09:10,880
And the tree.

1981
01:09:10,880 --> 01:09:12,880
Good tidings we bring.

1982
01:09:12,880 --> 01:09:14,880
Does everyone come in?

1983
01:09:14,880 --> 01:09:16,880
Okay.

1984
01:09:16,880 --> 01:09:18,880
Okay.

1985
01:09:20,880 --> 01:09:22,880
Oh, my God.

1986
01:09:22,880 --> 01:09:24,880
It's a pretty

1987
01:09:24,880 --> 01:09:26,880
decorated Bernie.

1988
01:09:26,880 --> 01:09:28,880
It's so lovely, right?

1989
01:09:28,880 --> 01:09:30,880
We're going to say goodbye

1990
01:09:30,880 --> 01:09:32,880
to our Bernie.

1991
01:09:32,880 --> 01:09:34,880
Everyone.

1992
01:09:34,880 --> 01:09:36,880
We're going to say goodbye to our Bernie.

1993
01:09:36,880 --> 01:09:38,880
So, if you're going to say goodbye to Bernie,

1994
01:09:38,880 --> 01:09:40,880
I'll go forward like this.

1995
01:09:40,880 --> 01:09:42,880
Okay?

1996
01:09:42,880 --> 01:09:44,880
Okay.

1997
01:09:44,880 --> 01:09:46,880
It's so cute.

1998
01:09:46,880 --> 01:09:48,880
Are you ready?

1999
01:09:48,880 --> 01:09:50,880
Three, two, one.

2000
01:09:50,880 --> 01:09:52,880
Wow.
